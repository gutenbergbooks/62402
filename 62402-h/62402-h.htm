<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">There</span> is no name in the annals of science which has
been the occasion of so long and fierce a controversy
as that of Galileo. The historian, the astronomer,
and the theologian have all had a share in it. Sometimes
there has been a pause in the strife, and the
question has been allowed to rest; but after a while
another disputant has rekindled the embers, and the
struggle has recommenced. This has been the case
within the last few years, some writers of considerable
ability having appealed to the history of Galileo
in order to give point to opinions that they wished to
advance. During all this time, if there has been
unfairness on one side, there have been injudicious
zeal and inaccuracy on the other.</p>

<p>These circumstances must form my apology for
interfering in a dispute already so prolonged and
so envenomed; and it has appeared to me that I
may without presumption hope to amend the errors<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">vi</span>
to which I have just alluded, if in no other way,
at least by stating correctly the facts of the case.
I do not, however, undertake to write a full biography
of the great philosopher, or to give a detailed
account of his numerous contributions to the scientific
literature of his day; I confine myself principally to
those great crises in his life which have given rise to
so much discussion, and which have chiefly contributed
to make him a name in history.</p>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">Before</span> entering on any details relating to Galileo’s
life and works, I propose to give a brief sketch of the
progress of astronomical knowledge up to his time;
for without this, one cannot appreciate correctly the
value of his contributions to science, a value exaggerated
or underrated by different writers, each
according to his respective bias.</p>

<p>The primitive conception of the Earth as a vast
plain with the ocean flowing round it, and the solid
firmament in the sky above it, with the Sun, Moon,
and Stars driven across by some mysterious agency,
need not be noticed from an astronomical point of
view; it appeared naturally in ancient poetry and in
the forms of speech adopted and continued by popular
usage; but it is not necessary to dwell upon it.</p>

<p>The first astronomers with whom we are acquainted
were the Greeks, though it is said by some writers that
the Chaldeans and Egyptians were really the original
astronomers of the ancient world, and what the
Greeks knew was borrowed from them.</p>

<p>The vast majority of men from the earliest times<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
down to the birth of Galileo believed that the Earth
was the centre of the universe, round which the Sun,
Moon, and Stars revolved every twenty-four hours;
round which, also (as careful observers had perceived),
the Sun had an annual motion, progressing through
the various signs of the zodiac; moreover, it had
been noticed that the planets moved round the Earth,
though at widely differing periods.</p>

<p>Yet there had been some few men, exceptionally
gifted, who had guessed (and truly so) that the
popular conception was a wrong one. It is said
that the old Greek philosopher, Pythagoras,
taught his disciples that the Sun was the real
centre of our system, and that the Earth and
planets circulated round it; but he does not seem to
have openly and explicitly published his doctrine,
though the tradition of his having so taught has
always existed. If he taught it, however, he stands
almost alone among the ancients. There were two
great authorities in particular, whose opinion carried
immense weight, and who were both decided in
holding that the Earth was the centre, and the
Sun a revolving planet. The first of these, Aristotle,
has exercised an influence over succeeding generations
which is simply marvellous. How vast was
the weight of his name as a philosopher in the
age of the schoolmen is well known to every one
who has ever glanced at the greatest work of the
greatest intellect of that age, the “Summa” of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
St. Thomas Aquinas. This celebrated writer quotes
him as “<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">philosophus</span>,” in his opinion <em>the philosopher
<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">par excellence</span></em>, and besides his general appreciation
of him as thus shown, he wrote an elaborate treatise
on the “Astronomy” of Aristotle.</p>

<p>Nor has this influence been confined to the schoolmen;
it has remained ever since, even to this day and
in this country, where in the University of Oxford his
great work on ethics is still a standard book of study.
At the time of Galileo, such was the reverence felt
towards his authority in Italy and in Rome, that the
Peripatetici, as those who specially belonged to his
school were called, were probably quite as indignant
with the revolutionary astronomer for disregarding
the teaching of their philosopher, as for going counter
to the literal interpretation of Scripture.</p>

<p>But in pure astronomy, apart from all other
philosophy, the greatest of all ancient writers was
Ptolemy, who in the second century of the Christian
era wrote a work called the “Almagest,” which is a
complete compendium of the science as known at that
date. Ptolemy probably borrowed very much from
his great predecessor, Hipparchus, who has been called
the father of astronomy, and who was the first to
discover—to take a remarkable instance—the phenomenon
known as the precession of the equinoxes,
involving as it does the difference in length between
the solar and sidereal years. The system of Ptolemy
was briefly this: The heavens and the Earth are
both spherical in form—the Earth being immovable in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
the centre, and all the heavenly motions taking place
in circles. For this he gives his reasons—sound and
good reasons for the spherical shape of the Earth;
unsound and mistaken, however, for the denial of the
Earth’s rotation on its axis, an opinion he evidently
knew had been maintained by some persons; one
important argument on this latter head being that if
the Earth rotated with the great velocity necessary to
carry it round in one day, it would leave the air
behind it. He places the Earth (as already said) in
the centre, then the Moon as the nearest planet revolving
round it, the next Mercury, then Venus, then
the Sun, and beyond these Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn.
All moved in circles, but since, with the exception of
the Sun and Moon, simple circles would not account
for the motions, he supposes small circles in a retrograde
direction forming loops upon the main circle,
which he calls <em>epicycles</em>; undoubtedly following in this
respect, Hipparchus, who three centuries before had
struck out the same idea. It is curious that Ptolemy’s
arguments (as above mentioned) show clearly that in
his day there were some persons, though their names
have perished,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> some one or two philosophers
endowed with a marvellous insight into Nature, who
had guessed at the true solution of the great astronomical
problem; but they left no enduring mark
on their age. The system of Ptolemy accounted for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
all the phenomena of the heavenly bodies that could
be observed without the use of the telescope; naturally
it held undisputed sway for many generations.</p>

<p>The first writer who revived the doctrine of
Pythagoras as to the Earth’s movement (if, indeed,
Pythagoras ever really taught it) was Nicholas de
Cusa; he was a German by birth, having, in fact,
been born at Trèves, in 1401; but he was educated
in Italy. He rose to a high ecclesiastical position,
and was created cardinal by Pope Eugenius IV., in
1448; his book just alluded to was entitled “De
Docta Ignorantia,” and was dedicated to Cardinal
Cesarini.</p>

<p>The first, however, whose work obtained any great
notoriety, and who upheld the doctrine that the Earth
revolved around the Sun, was Nicholas Kopernik,
commonly called by the Latinised form of his name,
Copernicus. He, too, was a German, born at Thorn,
in 1473; he studied for a time at the University of
Cracow, and like Nicholas de Cusa, afterwards in
Italy, and was subsequently raised to the ecclesiastical
dignity of a Canon. It is probable that he
was not a priest (though he is frequently spoken
of as such), but a Canon in minor orders. In 1500
he was appointed professor of mathematics at
Rome; and such was his scientific reputation that
he was consulted by the Council of Lateran, held
in 1512, on the question of the reform of the calendar—a
reform carried out at a later period by Pope
Gregory XIII.</p>

<p>The system of Copernicus was well received at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
Rome. A German disciple of his, John Albert
Widmanstadt, in the year 1533, expounded it before
Pope Clement VII., and produced a very favourable
impression. Nor was the favour shown to Copernicus
and his teaching ever withdrawn at Rome; his great
work, “De Revolutionibus Orbium Cœlestium”
(published, it is said, by the advice of Cardinal
Schunberg, Bishop of Capua), was dedicated to the
reigning Pope, Paul III.; nor does he appear to have
received at any time the least rebuke or discouragement
from the Holy See; he died, however, immediately
after the printing of his book, in May, 1543.</p>

<p>Copernicus supposed the heavenly bodies, the
Earth included, to revolve round the Sun in <em>circles</em>;
but, as it was evident that they did not exactly do
this, he used the theory of epicycles, and supposed
each planet to make two revolutions in each epicycle
for every revolution round the Sun. The true solution
of the difficulty was due to Kepler, who lived in the
next century, and who discovered that the planets
moved in <em>ellipses</em>. Copernicus held, and, of course,
held truly, that the Earth revolves on its axis,
thereby causing the apparent diurnal motion of all
the heavenly bodies from east to west.</p>

<p>Owing to his work having been the first of any
great importance that maintained argumentatively
the system called <em>heliocentric</em>, that is to say, in
which the Sun is the real centre, round which the
planets, including the Earth, revolve—for the treatise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
of Nicholas de Cusa does not appear to have had any
extensive circulation—it is usual to speak of this
system as the <em>Copernican</em> one, notwithstanding the
errors from which its great author was unable to
extricate himself, and which have long since been
rectified by subsequent writers; so that even at
this day we retain the name.</p>

<p>It is always useful in scientific subjects to introduce
a definition; and this is my definition of the
sense in which I employ the word Copernican, that it
is simply as opposed to the system in which the
Earth is the centre of the visible universe, and the
Sun revolving about it. It is, in fact, less accurate
but more convenient than the employment of the
Greek words heliocentric and geocentric to denote the
two systems. Greek words, no doubt, abound in our
scientific vocabulary, as the following plainly show:
astronomy, geology, geography, barometer, thermometer,
microscope, telescope; but these have become
naturalised in our language by long use, which heliocentric
and geocentric have not as yet been.</p>

<p>After Copernicus there arose an astronomer of
great merit, a Dane, Tycho Brahé by name, who
attempted to start a fresh system—a modification, in
fact, of that of Ptolemy. He made all the
planets revolve round the Sun, and the Sun,
accompanied by the planets, round the Earth.
He deserves great credit for his painstaking observations;
but he lived just before the invention of
the telescope—or, at least, before it was used for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
astronomical purposes—and, therefore, was under an
infinite disadvantage. His chief objection to the
system of Copernicus was one at which a modern
astronomer would smile, but which in those days
seemed very weighty—namely, the enormous distance
at which you must suppose the fixed stars to be
situated, if it were true. The philosophers of that
age did not like to admit such a waste of space as
that which must intervene between the orbit of
Saturn and the stars. And, on the Copernican
theory, if the stars were not situated at an immense,
almost infinite distance, they ought to appear to
move in a way they certainly do not. Tycho Brahé
was born in 1546. His theory never made much
way; it had not, I imagine, sufficient elements of
probability to recommend it generally; while the
subsequent invention of the telescope, and the works
of Kepler and Galileo, coming so soon after Tycho
Brahé, prepared the way for that almost universal
reception of the Copernican system which we have
since witnessed. I shall refer later on to Tycho and
his observations.</p>

<p>Such, then, was the state of astronomical theories
in the latter part of the sixteenth century. Enlightened
men like Copernicus had guessed—not
accurately, it is true, but with a considerable
approach to accuracy—at the real facts of the case.
Tycho Brahé (who, I suspect, would have been converted
to Copernicanism if his life had been prolonged)
had suggested a system of compromise not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
likely, in the long run, to satisfy any thoughtful
mind; while the bulk of men, even the learned,
adhered to the old Ptolemaic scheme. Something,
however, now occurred which was destined to work,
sooner or later, a complete revolution in astronomy.
The telescope was invented, and, at the same time,
there arose a man who knew how to use it: that
man was Galileo. He was not the inventor of it,
for it was first constructed in Holland or Belgium;
yet he had the energy and the skill to make a
telescope, without having previously seen one, simply
from the account he had heard of the instrument.
The telescope that he constructed, which still bears
his name, was the simplest possible. It was of a
form now disused excepting for opera-glasses and
for the far more powerful binocular field-glasses with
which we are so familiar; but for telescopes properly
so called an improved principle has long since
been introduced. Galileo was the first man that
ever, so far as we know, turned the telescope upon
the heavens. How he was rewarded for his pains
we shall presently see; and I propose to introduce
a narrative of the principal events in his
life, since there are no means for forming a judgment
so valuable as having the facts of the case clearly
before the mind.</p>

<p>For most of the facts I am indebted to M. Henri
de l’Épinois, whose elaborate article in the French
publication known as <cite xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">La Revue des Questions
Historiques</cite> is of the highest value; as the author<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
of this article has done what I suspect very few
writers on Galileo have even attempted to do,
namely, to inspect the documents preserved in the
Vatican bearing on the process, some of which he
gives at full length. Not having myself had the
same advantage, I yet feel that I am treading on safe
ground when I take my facts from M. de l’Épinois;
for there is scarcely a statement that he makes for
which he does not give his authority, whether from
the documents just mentioned, or from Galileo’s own
letters, or from other trustworthy evidence.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></p>

<p>To treat of Galileo, and to pass over the events
which brought him into collision with the ecclesiastical
authorities, would of course be impossible, nor
is it easy to touch upon these matters without having
some standpoint of one’s own—some principle to
guide one, some basis from which to argue. I do
not shrink from stating that I write from a Catholic
standpoint; but without entering minutely into those
subtle questions which are the province of the trained
theologian.</p>

<p>As, however, a good deal of the narrative is
connected with the action of the Roman Congregations,
as they are termed, it may not be superfluous
to explain briefly the nature of these institutions.
They are formed by the selection of certain Cardinals,
one of them acting as Prefect of the Congregation,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
to whom are added other ecclesiastics as consultors
and as secretary. The Congregation of the Index, to
which reference will hereafter be made, was instituted
not long after the Council of Trent, by Pope
St. Pius V., and has for its duty, as its name implies,
the pointing out to the faithful people such books
as they ought to abstain from reading. The chief
consultor of the Index is the “Master of the Apostolic
Palace,” whom I shall have occasion to mention
more than once in connection with that Dialogue
of Galileo which brought him into such serious
disgrace at Rome.</p>

<p>The Congregation of the Inquisition—I need hardly
say, not to be confounded with the Spanish tribunal
of that name, which was founded at an earlier period,
nor with similar tribunals in other countries—was
erected in 1542 by Pope Paul III., and besides the
other officials attached to it, had certain theologians
called “qualifiers,” whose duty it was to give an opinion
to the Congregation on questions submitted to them.</p>

<p>These two Congregations, as well as several others
which it is not necessary to enumerate, still exist,
their functions being somewhat modified by the
changing circumstances of the age. Their action
is for the most part confined to matters of discipline,
but they sometimes have questions of doctrine and
moral obligation referred to them by the Pope, from
whom, of course, they derive all authority that they
possess.</p>

<p>I do not here undertake to show the advantage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
and utility of these Congregations, or of any other
institutions connected with the discipline of the
Catholic Church. From the remarks I have just
previously made, it will be understood that I take
all this for granted, and that I feel justified in doing
so. Those who differ from me will, I trust, excuse
me when they find that this conviction on my part
does not interfere with the impartial fairness of
my narrative.</p>

<p>Galileo, whom I believe to have been a devout
Catholic, would, if he were here to speak for himself,
agree with me in principle, however he might complain
of the action of the Roman Congregations in
his own individual case.</p>

<p>We shall then, as we proceed, inquire whether
this celebrated philosopher was, as some imagine,
a hero and a martyr of science, or, as others think,
a rash innovator, who happened by chance to be
right, but who had little or nothing but vain and
foolish arguments to adduce in support of his doctrines.
Perhaps we shall find that such critics,
on either side, are but imperfectly acquainted with
the facts of the case.</p>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">Galileo Galilei Linceo</span>—for such was his name in
full—was born at Pisa, the 18th February, 1564.
When about seventeen years old he commenced studying
mathematics and physical science at the University
of Pisa, and later on, in 1585, he came to Florence,
in order to go through a mathematical course.</p>

<p>He seems to have been wholly free from the sceptical
and irreligious spirit which unhappily warps the
judgment of some scientific men in our own day.
His moral conduct, however, in early life was not
irreproachable, and it is recorded of him that he had
a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">liaison</i> with a lady named Maria Gamba, who became
the mother of three children; but this illicit
attachment did not last very long, and a separation
took place, after which he saw Maria Gamba no more,
and she was subsequently married to some other
person. He then entered the celebrated monastery
of Vallombrosa, where he was a novice for a short
period; but, having apparently no vocation for the
religious life, he left the monastery, and resumed his
former pursuits. At the age of twenty-five he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
appointed professor of mathematics at Pisa, the Grand
Duke of Tuscany having invited him there on the
recommendation of Cardinal del Monte. Here it was
that he first excited hostility by attacking the theories
of Aristotle on physical science, a thing not to be
done with impunity in that age.</p>

<p>I have already alluded to the telescope constructed
by Galileo, and it is scarcely necessary to say that
such an instrument, however simple and rudimentary
in its construction, could not fail to reveal to an intelligent
observer truths hitherto unknown. It was
discovered that the planet Jupiter had satellites, that
Saturn had a ring, that Venus passed through phases
like the moon, that there were spots on the Sun;
this last discovery having been made about the same
time by the learned Jesuit, Father Scheiner, and by
Fabricius. It was not, I think, until the year 1610
that Galileo published his work called “Nuntius
Siderius,” in which he recounted the results he had
obtained. This work seems to have provoked some
considerable opposition, but Galileo was supported by
the approbation of his patron, the Grand Duke of
Tuscany. In the following year, 1611, he went to
Rome, and here he was well received and treated with
distinction by prelates of high position, and even by
the Pope then reigning, Paul V. Moreover, when, in
the year 1612, he published another work, which he
called “Discorso sui Gallegianti,” he met with general
approval, and no less a person than Cardinal Maffei
Barberini, who afterwards became Pope under the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
title of Urban VIII., is stated to have declared that
he was in all points of the same opinion as Galileo.</p>

<p>Now it is quite true that incidental conversations,
passing, perhaps, through the hands of two or three
persons, are not to be greatly relied upon. It is also
to be remarked that men in the position of Cardinals
or ecclesiastics of high rank may often look with
toleration and even favour on opinions stated in a
guarded and hypothetical way, and yet, if called on
to pronounce an official judgment on such opinions,
would feel it a duty to pronounce against them.
Nevertheless, there appears considerable reason for
thinking that since Galileo’s reputation stood so high,
and his ability was so manifest, he would have
escaped all censure if he had confined himself strictly
to stating his views on the Copernican system as a
scientific hypothesis, and had firmly resisted the
temptation (strong as it was) to allow himself to be
drawn into the Scriptural argument.</p>

<p>This, however, it must be remembered, was mainly
the fault of his opponents. Unable to grapple with
the question in its purely scientific aspect, some
zealous anti-Copernicans turned to Holy Scripture
for support—Scripture in its most rigid and literal
interpretation; an interpretation, however, it must
in fairness be stated, enshrined in the traditions of
successive generations.</p>

<p>It is said that a monk named Sizi went so far as to
maintain that the Bible contradicted the existence of
the satellites of Jupiter. If this be true (which one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
cannot help doubting), we may well say that amongst
all the perversions of Scripture in which human
fancy has indulged, there is scarcely any one more
monstrous; and we must not imagine that all the
Biblical arguments used against Galileo and Copernicus
were so unreasonable and exaggerated.</p>

<p>It was in 1613 that our philosopher published at
Rome another work, entitled “L’Istoria e Dimostrazione
Intorno alle Macchie Solari.” It was, generally
speaking, well received, though he drew a conclusion
in favour of the Earth’s rotation on its axis.</p>

<p>The controversy, however, became still keener on
the all-important point of the interpretation of Scripture.
Now that we can look back on the events of
that day with all judicious calmness, we may well
blame Galileo for having let himself fall into so dangerous
a snare; but there was some excuse for him,
attacked as he was on this very ground of the supposed
incompatibility of his hypothesis with the
teaching of Scripture; and so he unfortunately
committed a grave error of judgment in grappling
himself with a religious difficulty which, if wise, he
would have left entirely to theologians. It may be
said that this is not what we should naturally expect.
We should suppose that the ecclesiastical authorities
would welcome any attempt to prove that new
scientific theories were not irreconcilable with the
Scriptural narrative, and possibly such would be the
case at the present day; but in those times it was
certainly otherwise, and I am not quite sure whether<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
the tone and tendency of Rome (that is to say, Rome
as the centre of ecclesiastical tradition and authority)
is not still, as it was then, in favour of the same
rule of conduct—that, namely, which keeps a scientific
man to his own province, and leaves to the authorities
of the Church the duty of reconciling physical
theories and speculations with the teaching of Holy
Scripture. On this last-named point I need not say
I speak with the utmost diffidence; but on the historical
question, as to whether that was the feeling
which animated Popes and Cardinals in Galileo’s day,
I think there can be very little doubt.</p>

<p>Now, as the controversy became embittered, a
certain Father Cassini, a Dominican, preaching in
the Church of Santa Maria Novella at Florence,
attacked the Copernican doctrine as taught by
Galileo; this aroused the wrath of the philosopher,
and he wrote (on the 21st December, 1612) a letter
to a Benedictine monk, Father Castelli, protesting
against the interpretation of Scripture which Father
Cassini had used; and while so protesting, over-stepping,
it appears, the limits of prudence. The
result was that this unguarded letter was denounced
by Father Lorini to the Cardinal Prefect of the
Congregation of the Index.</p>

<p>The consequence of this was that in the early
part of the year 1615 there commenced a process
which in the following year had an important
issue. It is said that in the month of March, 1615,
Cardinal del Monte and Cardinal Bellarmine had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
a conversation on the subject of Galileo and his
teaching, the result being that they both agreed
on this one point: that Galileo ought to avoid entering
on the interpretation of Scripture, this being a
matter reserved to the ecclesiastical authorities.</p>

<p>Galileo was not then at Rome; and two influential
friends of his, Mgr. Dini and Prince Cesi, advised
him to be quiet and silent; such advice, however,
was not to his taste, and he, on the contrary,
thrust his head into the lion’s mouth, confident of
ultimate success. He came personally to Rome,
mixed in society, and endeavoured by the use of
such arguments as occurred to him in conversation
to refute the ancient opinions. Several of his friends,
including some of the Cardinals, advised moderation,
but in vain; and such was his confidence in his cause,
that in the early part of the year 1616 he actually
began to complain of the delay in the process.</p>

<p>The Pope looked upon his conduct with evident
displeasure, and it is stated in a letter of Guicciardini
that on one occasion Cardinal Orsini spoke to him
in favour of Galileo, and he answered that the
Cardinal would do well to persuade his friend to
abandon his opinion—adding that the affair was
placed in the hands of the Cardinals of the Holy
Office. After this incident, it is said, the Pope sent
for Bellarmine, talked the matter over with him,
and agreed that Galileo’s opinion was erroneous
and heretical. A decided step was now taken:
on the 19th February, 1616, there was sent to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
certain theologians belonging to the Congregation
of the Inquisition—technically called the <em>Qualifiers</em>—a
copy of the propositions, the censure of which had
been demanded: 1st, That the Sun was the centre of
the world, and consequently immovable locally; 2nd,
That the Earth was not the centre of the world, nor immovable,
but moved round itself by a diurnal rotation.</p>

<p>The Qualifiers of the Congregation met on the
23rd February, and on the next day, in presence
of the eleven theologians who had been consulted,
the censure was pronounced. All declared that the
first proposition was foolish and absurd, philosophically
speaking, and also formally heretical, since it
expressly contradicted numerous texts of Holy
Scripture, according to the proper meaning of the
words, and according to the ordinary interpretation
and the sense admitted by the holy Fathers and
theological doctors. All declared that the second
proposition deserved the same censure philosophically,
and regarding theological truth, that it was
at least erroneous in point of faith. The next day,
25th February, Cardinal Mellinus notified to the
Commissary of the Holy Office what had taken
place, and the Pope desired Cardinal Bellarmine to
send for Galileo, and admonish him to abandon
the opinion in question; if he refused to obey, the
Father Commissary, in presence of a notary and
witnesses, was to enjoin upon him a command to
abstain wholly from teaching such doctrine and
opinion, from defending it, or treating of it; if,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
however, he would not acquiesce, that he should
then be imprisoned. On the following day, 26th
February, this was accordingly done, and Galileo was
warned “<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">ut supra dictum opinionem... omnino
relinquat, nec eam de cetero quovis modo doceat
teneat aut defendat verbo aut scriptis</span>,” with the
threat already mentioned in case of disobedience.
Galileo promised to obey.</p>

<p>In the beginning of the month of March there
appeared a printed decree of the Congregation of
the Index prohibiting five works; and here we arrive
at the curious fact that no work whatever of Galileo
was prohibited by name. The feeling in the high
ecclesiastical circles of Rome seems at that time to
have been very much to this effect: “Let us stamp
out the obnoxious opinion, but let us spare Galileo
individually.” The final result (including what took
place in after years) is strikingly contrasted with
such expectations, if they existed. Galileo had
to suffer personally, not bodily torture or incarceration,
but humiliation and failure; whilst the
dreaded doctrine of Copernicanism, purified from
incidental error and taught in an enlightened form,
has triumphed and reigns supreme. The decree
of the Index is particularly noteworthy, for it is the
principal matter with which we have to deal. After
prohibiting certain Protestant books, the decree proceeds
as follows: “And since it has come to the
knowledge of the above-named Sacred Congregation
that that false Pythagorean doctrine, altogether contrary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
to Holy Scripture, concerning the movement
of the Earth and the immobility of the Sun, taught by
Nicolas Copernicus in his work on the Revolutions
of the Heavenly Orbs, and by Diego di Zunica in his
work on Job, is already spread about and received by
many persons, as may be seen in a printed letter
of a certain Carmelite Father, entitled ‘A Letter
of the Rev. Father, Master Paul Anthony Foscarini,
on the opinion of the Pythagoreans and of Copernicus
respecting the mobility of the Earth and the stability
of the Sun, and the new Pythagorean System of
the World,’ printed at Naples by Lazzaro Scorrigio,
1615, in which the said Father endeavours to show
that the aforesaid doctrine of the immobility of the Sun
in the centre of the universe and the mobility of the
Earth is consonant to the truth, and is not opposed
to Holy Scripture: Therefore, lest any opinion of
this kind insinuate itself to the detriment of Catholic
truth, [the Congregation] has decreed that the said
[works of] <cite>Nicolas Copernicus on the Revolutions
of the Orbs</cite> and <cite>Diego di Zunica on Job</cite> should
be suspended until they are corrected. But that
the book of Father Paul Anthony Foscarini the
Carmelite should be altogether prohibited and condemned;
and that all other books teaching the same
thing should equally be prohibited, as by the present
decree it prohibits, condemns, and suspends them all
respectively. In witness whereof the present decree
has been signed and sealed by the hand and seal
of the Most Illustrious and Most Reverend Lord<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
Cardinal of Santa Cecilia, Bishop of Albano, on the
5th day of March, 1616.”</p>

<p>Here follow the signatures:</p>

<p class="in0 in4">
“<span class="smcap">P. Episc. Albanen. Card. Sanctæ Cæciliæ.</span><br />
<span class="in6 vmid">“<i>Locus</i></span> <img src="images/mcross.png" width="23" height="23" alt="Maltese cross" /><!--<span class="large bold vmid">✠</span>--> <span class="vmid"><i>sigilli</i>.</span><br />
“<span class="smcap">F. Franciscus Magdalenus Capiferreus</span>,<br />
<span class="in6">“<i>Ord. Prædicat., Secretarius</i>.”</span>
</p>
<p>There followed a somewhat remarkable episode:
some opponents of Galileo having spread a report
that he had been compelled to make an abjuration,
and also had had certain salutary penances inflicted
on him, Cardinal Bellarmine gave him a certificate
to the effect that nothing of the kind had taken
place, but only that the declaration made by the
Pope and published by the Congregation of the
Index had been communicated to him; in which
declaration was contained the statement that the
doctrine attributed to Copernicus on the movement
of the Earth round the Sun, and the stability of the
Sun in the centre of the world without its moving
from east to west, was contrary to Holy Scripture,
and so could not be defended or held. It appears
that the abjuration alluded to was a solemn act
demanded only from those who were suspected of
unsoundness in the faith, and carried with it some
disgrace. Galileo was naturally anxious to be cleared
from such imputation, and the authorities in Rome
willingly met him so far, and avoided all acts casting
a personal slur on him. It is noteworthy that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
interview between Cardinal Bellarmine and Galileo
took place after the answers had been returned by
the Qualifiers of the Inquisition, but before the publication
of the decree of the Index. The certificate
given by the Cardinal, to which I have just alluded,
was subsequent, and bears date the 26th May, 1616.</p>

<p>And here we may pause in the narrative, to
inquire briefly what was the effect, in an ecclesiastical
point of view, of the decree just quoted, and of the
admonition given by Papal order to Galileo. On
the mere face of it, it cannot surely be maintained
that there was any doctrinal decision, strictly speaking,
at all. I do not wish to undervalue the importance
of the disciplinary decision, I think it most
momentous; moreover, the reason alleged for it was
that the opinion, the publication of which was to
be forbidden, was contrary to Scripture; but I fail
to see how this last-mentioned fact can possibly
convert what is avowedly a disciplinary enactment,
prohibiting the circulation of certain books, into a
dogmatic decree.</p>

<p>I should submit it to the judgment of theologians
whether this would not be true even if the Pope’s
name had been explicitly introduced as sanctioning
the decree; as it stands, however, the decree
appears simply in the name of the Congregation of
the Index.</p>

<p>It would, I think, scarcely be necessary to argue
these points at length, were it not that the contrary
view has been maintained in a work entitled “The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
Pontifical Decrees against the Doctrine of the
Earth’s Movement, and the Ultramontane Defence
of them,” by the Rev. William W. Roberts, a work
written with ability and moderation as well as considerable
knowledge of the subject, since the author,
though determined to make all the controversial
capital that is possible out of the case of Galileo,
rises superior to the vulgar atmosphere of fable and
false accusation; never alleges anything like personal
cruelty or ill-treatment as against the Pope or the
Inquisition, and scarcely alludes to the mythical
story of “<span xml:lang="it" lang="it">E pur si muove</span>.”</p>

<p>Moreover, even were the intrinsic value of the
work less than it is, attention has been publicly
drawn to it by a writer whom, both from a religious
and scientific point of view, we feel bound to treat
with respect—Professor Mivart—although he has
formed, on the other hand, an exaggerated estimate
of the importance of Mr. Roberts’ facts and arguments.</p>

<p>Here I wish to introduce an observation, as a
sort of anticipatory self-defence, which is that I
do not feel bound to enter into all the theological
minutiæ which learned disputants have introduced
into this case. Those who wish to sift such arguments
in detail can read the articles in <cite>The Dublin
Review</cite> by the late Dr. Ward (since republished)
on the one hand, and Mr. Roberts’ book on the other.
I myself venture to look at the question as a lay
theologian, employing this expression not by any
means in the sense of one who, having read two or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
three theological treatises, presumes to discuss the
sacred science, himself an amateur, with men whose
profession it is to teach theology; for, to use a
familiar expression, I hope I know my place better.
I employ the word in the sense of a man who seeks
to know what the Church teaches as requisite for
a layman, that is an <em>educated</em> layman, to understand:
thus the lay theologian, as I consider him, ought
to be able to discriminate between what the Church
teaches him as matter of faith and what she enjoins
or encourages him to hold under a less solemn
sanction. He ought also to distinguish clearly
between matters laid down by the Church as parts
of her definitive teaching both on faith and morals—points,
that is to say, laid down as of <em>principle</em>,
and therefore irrevocable—and on the other hand
matters of discipline which, whether intrinsically
important or not, may and do vary from age to age.
He may of course make mistakes, as even theologians
may do, in applying his principles to particular cases;
but he ought to understand what the principles
are.</p>

<p>Now applying such plain principles to the Galileo
case, I do not understand how any one can come
to any other conclusions than these: first, that the
decree of the Index and the other proceedings in
1616, though founded on reasons of doctrine, that
is of the correct interpretation of Scripture, were
purely disciplinary in their nature; secondly, that
this being so, they were not infallible or <em>irreformable</em>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
as the term is; thirdly, that they were,
however, real acts of discipline, and intended to
be enforced more or less stringently according to
circumstances. This last-named aspect of the case
is a matter of importance, and I shall return to
it hereafter; but the attempt to impugn the doctrinal
infallibility of the Catholic Church on the strength
of such decisions as that of the Index in 1616, seems
to me so groundless that I should not discuss the
question further were it not that I think it right
to notice some of Mr. Roberts’ arguments.</p>

<p>It appears that certain theologians have held that
decrees of the Roman Congregations are to be
considered infallible, provided they contain a statement
in so many words that the Pope has approved
them, and provided also that they have been published
by his explicit order. This, it may be
mentioned, does not necessarily imply that such
decrees concern matters which are strictly and
technically matters of <em>faith</em>, other less momentous
issues being frequently involved.</p>

<p>The decree of the Index in 1616 had no such
statement about the Pope’s approbation, nor any
notice of his express order for its publication,
although, in reality, it was undoubtedly approved
by him. Mr. Roberts argues that this distinction is
a worthless one, because, at that time, the custom,
since adopted on certain important occasions, of
bringing in the Pope’s name and authority explicitly,
had not come into being.</p>

<p>As an <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">argumentum ad hominem</i> against certain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
writers who have suggested that such an omission in
the Galileo case was a remarkable instance of Divine
Providence, Mr. Roberts’ answer may stand; but it
has nothing to do with the main argument. It only
shows that whereas the Popes of more modern times
have employed the Roman Congregations as instruments
for conveying to the world their own decrees
on certain doctrinal subjects, the Popes of the early
part of the seventeenth century had no such custom.
They used the Congregations for various disciplinary
purposes, founded sometimes, no doubt, on reasons of
doctrine, and they sanctioned the proceedings so
taken; but they did not give them the explicit impress
of their own name and authority. Even when
this latter has taken place, it is not every theologian
who holds that such decree is infallible. Cardinal
Franzelin, a writer of the highest authority, whose
words I give in a note,<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> held that it was not infallibly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
true, but only infallibly safe. His language
is not quite clear to the non-theological mind, but he
probably meant that the doctrine conveyed in such a
decree was safe, so that it might certainly be held
without injury to any one’s faith, and that it was
not safe to reject it. But it is clear that he was
not speaking of such decrees as took place in the
Galileo case, but only of those which bear on them
the marks of Papal authority in the strict sense.</p>

<p>His own words are pretty plain proof of this.
They are extracted from his work, “De Divina
Traditione et Scriptura,” and follow the other words
to which I have alluded:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Coroll. D. Auctoritas infallibilitatis et supremum magisterium
Pontificis definientis omnino nihil unquam pertinuit ad causam
Galilei Galilei, et ad ejurationem opinionis ipsi injunctam. Non
solum enim nulla vel umbra definitionis Pontificiæ ibi intercessit,
sed in toto illo decreto Cardinalium S. Officii, et in formula
ejurationis ne nomen quidem Pontificis unquam sive directe sive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
indirecte pronuntiatum reperitur... pertinebat omnino ad
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">auctoritatem providentiæ ecclesiasticæ</i> cavere, ne quid detrimenti
caperet interpretatio Scripturæ per conjecturas et hypotheses plerisque
tum temporis visas minime verisimiles.</p></blockquote>

<p>We are not, however, I think, obliged to endorse
the opinion conveyed in the last sentence that I have
quoted, though certain theologians of great weight
have held that the ecclesiastical authorities of Galileo’s
day were only acting with proper prudence in the
then existing state of astronomical knowledge. I
shall hereafter state why I feel it difficult to follow
their judgment.</p>

<p>But the words I have quoted from Cardinal
Franzelin show plainly that the decrees he had in his
mind, when he wrote that they were infallibly safe,
were of a nature quite different from anything that
took place in the processes connected with Galileo;
and although he alludes principally to that which
passed in 1633 before the Inquisition, he appears to
include the whole affair in the judgment he passes
upon it; indeed, the sentence of the tribunal in 1633,
and the abjuration enjoined upon Galileo at that time,
were made to depend on the decree of the Index in
1616, and the admonition then given to Galileo by
Cardinal Bellarmine. Cardinal Franzelin’s opinion,
then, whatever weight we may give to it, is clear
enough.</p>

<p>I give one more extract from the work of this
learned author on the subject of the Pope’s infallibility,
showing that he was of opinion that doctrinal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
definitions must be clearly and unmistakably intended
as such, and must carry with them some manifest
signs to that effect.</p>

<p>Extract from the same on the subject of the Pope’s
infallibility, pp. 108 and 109:</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Neque enim <em>Cathedra Apostolica</em> aliud est, quam supremum
authenticum magisterium, cujus definitiva sententia doctrinalis
obligat universam Ecclesiam ad consensum. Intentio hæc definiendi
doctrinam seu docendi definitivâ sententiâ et auctoritate
obligante universam Ecclesiam ad consensum debet esse manifesta
et cognoscibilis claris indiciis.</span></p></blockquote>

<p>In the case we have before us, I should say that the
“<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">clara indicia</span>” were all the other way; and indeed,
were it not for the dust which controversialists
have tried to throw in our eyes, I should be disposed
to add that we might fairly drop this part of our
subject—I mean the part which raises the question
whether there was not some decision or definition,
such as Catholics are bound by their principles to
admit as infallible, given against the Copernican
doctrine.</p>

<p>It is right, however, to notice one or two other
arguments urged by Mr. Roberts.</p>

<p>Some of these consist in bringing forward supposed
parallel cases, in which the Pope has insisted on a full
and complete assent being given to the decision of
some Roman Congregation. One case is that of a
“distinguished theologian and philosopher, Günther,”
whose works were condemned by a decree of the
Index, having, however, the notice that the Pope had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
ratified the decision and ordered its publication. This
was in 1857. Günther and many of his followers
submitted, but others contended that a merely disciplinary
decree was not conclusive. On this Pope
Pius IX. addressed a brief to the Archbishop of
Cologne, in which he intimated that a decree sanctioned
by his authority and published by his order
should have been sufficient to close the question, that
the doctrine taught by Günther could not be held to
be true, and that it was not permitted to any one to
defend it from that time forward.</p>

<p>I extract the words as given by Mr. Roberts:</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Quod quidem Decretum [that of the Index] Nostra Auctoritate
sancitum Nostroque jussu vulgatum, sufficere plane debebat, ut
questio omnis penitus dirempta censeretur, et omnes qui Catholico
gloriantur nomine clare aperteque intelligerent sibi esse omnino
obtemperandum, et sinceram haberi non posse doctrinam Güntharianis
libris contentam, ac nemini deinceps fas esse doctrinam iis
libris traditam tueri ac propugnare, et illos libros sine debita
facultate legere ac retinere.</span></p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. Roberts, it must be remembered, is not simply
investigating the history of Galileo, but is contending,
for other reasons, against certain opinions on the subject
of Papal infallibility held by an able foreign theologian,
M. Bouix, and by Dr. Ward, and he uses
Galileo as a weapon (and, in his estimation, a most formidable
weapon) in the controversy. Now, in the
capacity I have assumed of a <em>lay theologian</em>, I do not
feel bound to discuss whether the decree in Günther’s
case was merely disciplinary, or whether it was dogmatic;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
whether it came within the category of strictly
infallible pronouncements, or whether it did not; and
supposing the former alternative, whether it was infallible
in virtue of the Pope’s sanction and command
to publish in the first instance, or whether it only
became so in virtue of the brief addressed to the
Archbishop of Cologne. All these questions, interesting
in themselves, I feel myself at liberty to pass
over, and to leave them, with the most profound
respect, to be sifted by professed theologians; I
merely venture to remark, without attempting to
argue the matter, that, to my uninstructed intelligence,
the whole thing, including the Pope’s brief,
appears to have a disciplinary character rather than
anything else.</p>

<p>What, however, I would say is this—the questions
above mentioned, which in the Günther case are
doubtful, are in that of Galileo clear enough; the
clause stating that the Pope had sanctioned the decree,
and ordered it to be published, on which the doubt
alluded to is founded, did not appear in the decree
against the Copernican books; nor did the Popes of
that day issue any brief, such as Pius IX. addressed
to the Archbishop of Cologne.</p>

<p>Mr. Roberts, it is true, thinks he has a clenching
argument in a Bull of Pope Alexander VII., of which
I will speak hereafter, and which in my humble judgment
has the least force of any that he has adduced.</p>

<p>The case of Professor Ubaghs, of the University
of Louvain, which Mr. Roberts thinks still more to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
the point, seems, I confess, to me even weaker than
the other for our present purpose. Here, again, I
leave it to theologians to decide whether the decree
was or was not infallible; but it undoubtedly appears,
in point of form, to be a doctrinal one, and emanated
from the United Congregations of the Index and
Inquisition, to whom the Pope had expressly entrusted
the examination of the subject, and it was as follows:
“Wherefore the most eminent cardinals have arrived
at this opinion: that in the philosophical works,
hitherto published by G. C. Ubaghs, and especially
in his Logic and Theodicea, doctrines or opinions are
found that cannot be taught without danger” (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">inveniri
doctrinas seu opiniones, quæ absque periculo tradi
non possunt</i>). “Which judgment our most Holy
Lord Pope Pius IX. has ratified and confirmed by his
supreme authority.” Even then some persons maintained
that the decree was disciplinary and not doctrinal.
Cardinal Patrizi, however, writing in the Pope’s name
to the Primate of Belgium (if I mistake not), intimated
that the dissentients must acquiesce <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ex animo</i>
in the judgment of the Apostolic See. Consequently
all the professors who had committed themselves to
the proscribed opinions were required to make an act
of submission to the effect just mentioned. The decree
was treated as strictly doctrinal, and if so was, I
maintain, essentially different from the one we have
now before us.</p>

<p>In the case of Galileo, it is true that the opinion
given in 1616 by the Qualifiers of the Inquisition was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
doctrinal one; the action taken upon the strength
of that opinion by the Pope in desiring Cardinal
Bellarmine to admonish Galileo, as well as by the
Congregation of the Index in prohibiting certain
books, was simply disciplinary.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a></p>

<p>It remains for us to inquire what was the value of
the decree of the Index on certain works, written
in favour of the new astronomical doctrines, as appreciated
by <em>contemporary</em> feeling and opinion. We
naturally find that there were two views on the
subject: one of those who wished to magnify the effect
of the decision, and one of those who desired to
minimise it.</p>

<p>Galileo himself said that his opinion had not been
accepted by the Church, which, however, had only
declared that it was not in conformity with Holy
Scripture; from which it followed that only books
attempting <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ex professo</i> to prove that the opinion is
not contrary to Scripture were prohibited. Whether
Galileo was right or wrong in his estimate of the
scope of the decree, it seems evident that he considered
the whole matter as a question merely of discipline.</p>

<p>It is said that Father Melchior Inchofer, S.J. (afterwards
one of the Consultors of the Holy Office),<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
endeavoured to prove that the decision proceeded
from the Pope speaking <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ex cathedrâ</i>. Mr. Roberts
gives a quotation to that effect from a work of
Professor Berti; the original, however, does not
appear, and is probably not now extant.</p>

<p>Mr. Roberts also quotes Caramuel, “the acute
casuist,” who, in answer to the supposed objection
that the Copernican theory might hereafter be shown
to be true, says that it is impossible that the Earth
should hereafter be proved demonstratively to be in
motion; if such an impossibility be admitted, other
impossible and absurd things would follow.</p>

<p>Caramuel, however great as a theologian, was
evidently not endowed with much scientific foresight.
But he is not wholly wrong, for it has never yet been
possible to prove by <em>absolute demonstration</em> the
motion of the Earth.</p>

<p>One of the most important witnesses on the point
we are here considering is Cardinal Bellarmine, who
was a very zealous anti-Copernican, and had probably
a great share (perhaps the principal share) in bringing
about the practical condemnation of Galileo’s opinions
in 1616. So far as I know, the only explicit statement
bearing on the question that we have of
Bellarmine’s, is a letter to the Carmelite Father
Foscarini, dated April 1, 1615, though he has been
quoted as if he had expressed the opinion stated in
the letter at a later date. Mr. Roberts takes exception
to the inference drawn from this letter
because it was written before the decree of the Index,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
and we may add, about seven months before the
referring of Galileo’s writings to the Consultors of the
Inquisition.</p>

<p>Now we may admit that there would be some force
in this argument if Cardinal Bellarmine, instead of
being what he was, had been a private individual,
having nothing to do but to listen submissively to
what his ecclesiastical superiors decided, whether in
doctrine or discipline. He was, however, one of the
most trusted advisers of the Pope; he had no small
share in bringing about the censure of the Copernican
theory, such as it was; and it is almost certain that
at the time when he wrote the letter he foresaw that
some proceedings of that nature would follow, if
indeed the proceedings had not already begun. We
have no sort of intimation that he ever afterwards
changed his opinion, and the way in which he was
quoted by subsequent writers points to this conclusion.
I have thought it better to answer the objection made
by Mr. Roberts before stating what Bellarmine’s letter
contains. I must leave my readers to judge the value
of the argument. All I say is, that my own belief is
that Cardinal Bellarmine’s opinion, as recorded in this
letter to Father Foscarini, represents his permanent
judgment. It is a most curious letter, and is a
singular illustration of the danger that a man, however
able and learned, may incur by attempting to
grapple with subjects of which he knows absolutely
nothing. Bellarmine, when writing on theological or
controversial subjects, though he might make an occasional<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
mistake, was one of the clearest, ablest, and (may
one not add?) fairest of writers; but on a subject such
as this, some of his reasoning strikes us as very curious.</p>

<p>The substance of it is as follows: After admitting
that so long as the Copernican doctrine is stated
hypothetically, “<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ex suppositione</i>,” there is no objection
whatever to it, he goes on to say that to state it
positively and as a reality is contrary to the principle
laid down by the Council (<i>i.e.</i> of Trent), that
Scripture should not be interpreted contrary to the
common consent of the Fathers; and, he added, not
only that, but the universal opinions of modern
commentators. In answer to the objection that it is
not a matter of faith, he says: “if it is not so <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ex parte
objecti</i>, it is so <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ex parte dicentis</i>,” meaning apparently
that a man who impugned the truth of the Scriptural
narrative in any respect would be heretical. Then
follows the paragraph which has given occasion to
quote the letter, and it is to this effect:<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> When there
shall be a real demonstration that the Sun stands in
the centre of the universe, and that the Earth revolves
round it, it will then be necessary to proceed with great
consideration in explaining those passages of Scripture<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
which seem to be contrary to it, and rather to say
that we do not understand them, than say that a
thing which is demonstrated is false. But for his own
part, until it had been shown to him, he would not
believe there could be any such demonstration, for it
was one thing to prove that if the hypothesis were
true all things would appear as they actually do, and
another thing to prove that such is actually the fact;
and in case of doubt one ought not to leave the interpretation
of Scripture as given by the Fathers. Then
comes what is really an extraordinary argument, as
we modern thinkers would view it. The text, “The
sun arises and sets, and returns to his own place,” was
written by Solomon, who was not only inspired by
God, but was also the wisest and most learned of
mankind in human sciences, and in the knowledge of
created things, and it was not likely he could be
wrong. Nor was it sufficient to say that Solomon
speaks according to appearances; for though in some
cases erroneous impressions, arising from appearances,
can be corrected by observation and experience, it is
quite otherwise as regards the motion of the Earth.</p>

<p>It is certainly remarkable that it does not appear
to strike Bellarmine that the Fathers and commentators,
not having this question before them, naturally
interpreted Scripture according to the ideas generally
entertained in their day. While to suppose that,
because Solomon wrote certain inspired works, and,
moreover, was a great naturalist—the greatest of his
day—he was, therefore, infallible in his personal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
views on astronomy, shows a state of mind so different
from what we find amongst even non-scientific
men in our own day, that we are almost startled and
bewildered when we meet with it. The truth, however,
is that Bellarmine was a sort of link between
the mediæval and modern thinkers; in theology and
controversy, and in appreciation of the change that
had taken place in Europe owing to the religious
revolution of the preceding century, in all that, he
was, I imagine, in advance of his age; in physical
science he was a simple mediævalist. But it was
not for some time that even able men came to
recognise the principle that in the search for truth, so
far as the works of Nature are concerned, the opinions
of the ancients and the traditions of forefathers count
but for little; and observation and experiment are
the true and only key to knowledge. It is otherwise,
of course, with theology and kindred studies;
and it required some mental grasp, or in default of
that it required a long, very long, experience before
the human mind drew the distinction between the
two.</p>

<p>But this is a digression. I have quoted Bellarmine
to show what he thought of the necessity, from an
ecclesiastical standpoint, of putting down Copernicanism,
at least until it should be proved to
demonstration. He did not appear to contemplate
a dogmatic decision against it, but what he did
desire, and succeeded in obtaining, was a disciplinary
prohibition of the obnoxious doctrine. As a theologian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
he well knew that such a prohibition would not be
an irrevocable act; it might be withdrawn when the
conclusive proof of the forbidden opinion should be
established. He probably thought that the certain
demonstration of the opinion would only take place,
as mathematicians would say, at an infinitely distant
date; nor was he wholly wrong, as has already been
remarked, for the absolute demonstration of the
Copernican doctrine is not, from the very nature of
the case, a thing to be achieved.</p>

<p>Yet, if he had lived at a later period, I do not
doubt that he would have been satisfied with the
moral evidence, the mass of indirect proof, on which
Copernicanism rests. Many years later, the Jesuit
Father Fabri, who appears to have held the office of
Canon Penitentiary of St. Peter’s, expresses himself
in much the same way as Bellarmine. He was
replying to the arguments of some Copernican
correspondent, possibly an Englishman, since his
reply was inserted in the Acts of the English Royal
Society in 1665, and he says: “There is no reason
why the Church should not understand those texts in
their literal sense, and declare that they should be
so understood so long as there is no demonstration to
prove the contrary. But if any such demonstration
hereafter be devised by your party (which I do not
at all expect), in that case the Church will not at all
hesitate to set forth that those texts are to be understood
in an improper—<i>i.e.</i>, non-literal—and figurative<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
sense, according to the words of the poet, ‘terræque
urbesque recedunt.’”</p>

<p>As a further illustration of the position thus taken
by Bellarmine and others as to the interpretation of
Scripture, I may here mention that some few years
after the prohibition of Copernican works by the
Index (probably about 1623), it is said that Guidacci
had an interview with Father Grassi, at the suggestion
of the Jesuit Father Tarquinio Galluzzi, and that F.
Grassi’s words were as follows: “When a demonstration
of this movement [that of the Earth] shall be discovered,
it will be fitting to interpret Scripture otherwise than
has hitherto been done: this is the opinion of
Cardinal Bellarmine.” It is not intended to deny that
there were those who magnified the effect of the
decree of the Index; the devotees of Aristotle, who
had gained what was to them a great triumph, were
sure to make the most of it.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">We</span> will now return to the narrative; and in due
course discuss the condemnation of Galileo by the
Inquisition sixteen years after the events just
described.</p>

<p>It may be mentioned, as illustrating the feeling in
Rome towards Galileo personally, that on the 11th
March, 1616, he had an audience, lasting three-quarters
of an hour, of Pope Paul V. He assured
the Pope of the rectitude of his intentions, and
complained of the persecutions of his adversaries.
Paul V. answered very kindly, saying that both
himself and the Cardinals of the Index had formed
a high personal opinion of him, and did not believe
his calumniators.</p>

<p>In the year 1620 there appeared a monitum of the
Congregation of the Index, permitting the reading of
the great work of Copernicus after certain specified
corrections had been made.</p>

<p>Not long after this, in 1622, if I mistake not, Pope
Paul V. died, and Galileo’s friend, Cardinal Barberini,
succeeded him, taking the name of Urban VIII.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
Another of his friends, Monsignor Ciampoli, became
secretary of briefs to the new Pope.</p>

<p>Our philosopher having ascertained that he would
be well received, went to Rome in April, 1624, and
was treated by the new Pope with all possible consideration.
He had, in fact, several conversations
with him; and we may well conjecture it was on
these occasions that Urban VIII., discussing the
Copernican theory, used some of those arguments
which Galileo afterwards put in the mouth of Simplicio
in his celebrated Dialogue, thereby deeply
offending the Pope.</p>

<p>But there was, about this time, a sort of moderate
reaction in favour of Galileo among the authorities
at Rome. For instance, a work of his published since
the decree of the Index, and entitled “<cite xml:lang="it" lang="it">Il Saggiatore</cite>,”
in which he had favoured the theory of the Earth’s
motion, was attacked, and an attempt was made to
have it prohibited or at least corrected, but the
attempt was a failure.</p>

<p>The reports of casual or unofficial conversations are
always to be received with caution and with some
qualification; yet at least they are “straws which
show how the wind blows.”</p>

<p>Thus we are told that Cardinal Hohen-Zollern, in
a conversation with the Pope (Urban VIII.) on the
subject of Copernicus, endeavoured to show the necessity
of proceeding with great circumspection on that
point, to which it is said the Pope replied that the
Church had not condemned and would not condemn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
that opinion as heretical, but only as temerarious.
So again the Master of the Sacred Palace, himself
resting neutral between Ptolemy and Copernicus, is
reported to have said that there was no matter of
faith in question, the great point being that one must
not in any way mix up the Holy Scriptures with it.</p>

<p>We may suppose that when the Pope spoke of the
opinion having been condemned as temerarious, what
he meant was not that it had been explicitly censured
as such—using the word in the technical sense which
it bears when applied as a censure—for that it plainly
had not been, but that the general effect of the prohibition
issued by the Index was to stamp the mark
of rashness upon it. This, I may observe, if it be
the right interpretation, is quite consistent with the
theory that the prohibition was of a disciplinary and
a provisional character.</p>

<p>We have also another reputed conversation of the
Pope with Campanella—resting on the authority of
Prince Cesi, who related it to Father Castelli—and it
is important if true. Campanella had said that certain
Germans, ready to embrace the Catholic faith,
had hesitated on account of the condemnation of
Copernicus, to which Pope Urban VIII. had replied
that this was not his intention, and if he had had
the arrangement of matters the decree would never
have been made. “<span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Non fu mai nostra intenzione, e se
fosse toccato a noi, non si sarebbe fatto quel decreto.</span>”</p>

<p>As already remarked, we must not attach too great
weight to reports of private conversations; but it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
probable that some such scene took place as here
represented, and, if it did, it is surely wholly incompatible
with the idea that the decree was a decision
in matters of faith. No Pope, no well-informed
ecclesiastic of any rank, would express himself so
in such a case; but it is quite consistent with what
we might expect in a question of simple discipline.</p>

<p>It will now be convenient, before discussing the
matter further, to resume the narrative, and to touch
upon the questions connected with the condemnation
of Galileo by the Inquisition, and his enforced abjuration.
It is, indeed, these latter proceedings that
have left so deep an impression upon the popular
mind, though, strictly speaking, they were of less
importance than the decree of the Index—of less importance,
that is, to all others besides Galileo himself.</p>

<p>It seems that our philosopher overrated the effect
of the reaction that had taken place in his favour,
real though it was so far as it went. He thought he
might now safely publish the work on which he had
been labouring, and on which he probably relied as
likely to influence the minds of learned men, ecclesiastical
as well as lay, in the direction of Copernicanism.</p>

<p>He came in May in the year 1630 to Rome, and
had a very long audience with the Pope, who treated
him with great kindness and even increased a pension
he had already bestowed upon him; but we do not
know what passed as to other matters on this occasion.
He had also an interview with Father Riccardi,
who had now become Master of the Sacred Palace,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
with a view of obtaining authority to print his book.
Father Riccardi upon this engaged Father Visconti,
who was a professor of mathematics, to read the work
and mark such passages as he thought necessary.</p>

<p>Father Visconti reported that there were some
passages which required correction, and many points
that he would like to discuss with the author. However,
the Master of the Sacred Palace gave leave for
the printing of the work, expressing at the same time
a wish to see it once more himself; consequently it
was arranged that Galileo should return to Rome in
the autumn, in order to add the preface, and to
insert in the body of the work certain passages,
calculated to show that the question was being
treated purely as a hypothesis.</p>

<p>Two untoward events, however, now occurred: one
was the death of Prince Cesi, a powerful and devoted
friend of Galileo, which took place on the 1st May;
and the other was the outbreak of the plague at
Florence, a circumstance which interrupted communications,
and caused delays resulting in mistakes
and misunderstandings. With a view of having the
Dialogue printed at Florence, it was arranged that
the revision required by the ecclesiastical authorities
should take place there instead of at Rome. Father
Hyacinthe Stephani, a Dominican, who acted as
reviser, marked several passages in the work, thinking
that they should be explained before the final permission
for publication was conceded.</p>

<p>Then followed mutual delays: the author was tardy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
in sending to Rome the corrections to which he had
in principle agreed, and the Master of the Sacred
Palace was late in sending to Florence the preface
and the conclusion, so the impatient philosopher began
to print his book. The plague still continued, and the
result was that communications were still interrupted.</p>

<p>The Inquisitor of Florence however received from
Rome the power to approve officially the copy of
Galileo’s work that would be submitted to him, with
instructions specially added by Father Riccardi that
he must bear in mind the wishes of the Pope to the
following effect: The title of the work must indicate
that it dealt only with the mathematical question
connected with Copernicanism, also that the Copernican
opinion must not be put forward as a positive
truth, but merely as a hypothesis, and this without
alluding to the interpretation of Scripture; moreover,
that it should be stated that the work was only
written to show that if the decree (<i>i.e.</i> of 1616) was
made at Rome, nevertheless the authorities knew all
the reasons against it that could be urged, and were
not ignorant of one of them—an idea conformable to
the words of the preface and the conclusion, which he
would send from Rome corrected. With this precaution,
it was intimated the book would meet with
no obstacle at Rome, and thus satisfaction might be
given to the author, and also to the Grand Duke of
Tuscany, who had shown himself to be so eager in the
matter.</p>

<p>This remarkable letter points towards a conclusion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
which has been drawn by some writers, that the
preface to the Dialogue was written for Galileo by
Father Riccardi or some other person, and was not
his own composition; for the above is precisely what
was said in the preface as it afterwards appeared,
and it seems to me almost incredible that Galileo
should have spontaneously written any such words,
exposing him to the charge, which has really been
made against him, of transparent irony, thereby
giving offence in the very quarters where conciliation
was desirable.</p>

<p>And it must be remarked that when Father
Riccardi on the 19th July of this year sent the
preface to Florence, he allowed Galileo the liberty of
making verbal alterations only; so that whether he
composed it or only revised it, it is Father Riccardi
rather than the author of the Dialogue who must be
held responsible for the contents, and the same
remark applies at least partially to the conclusion
also, it having been specially revised by the same
hand.</p>

<p>The preface is addressed to the discreet reader,
and the words to which I have just alluded are
as follows: “Some years ago, a wholesome edict was
promulgated in Rome which, in order to check the
dangerous scandals of the present age, imposed an
opportune silence upon the Pythagorean opinion of
the motion of the earth. There were not wanting
some who rashly asserted that that decree resulted,
not from judicious examination, but from ill-informed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
passion; and there were heard complaints
that Consultors, wholly inexperienced in astronomical
observations, ought not to be allowed, with a hasty
prohibition, to clip the wings of speculative intellects.
My zeal could not keep silence on hearing the temerity
of the complaints so made. As one fully informed
of that most prudent decision, I judged it right to
appear publicly in the theatre of the world, as
a witness of pure truth. I happened then to be
present in Rome; I had not only audiences, but
approbations from the most eminent prelates of that
Court, and it was not without my own previous
information that the publication of that decree then
followed.” The author goes on to say that he
wished to show to foreign nations how much was
known in Italy, and particularly in Rome, on this
subject; and that from this climate there proceed
not only dogmas for the salvation of the soul, but
ingenious devices for the delight of the mind.</p>

<p>This last clause certainly savours of bitter irony,
and probably did not proceed from Father Riccardi’s
pen. He then states that for the purpose in hand
he had taken the Copernican part in the Dialogue
as a pure mathematical hypothesis, endeavouring
by every artifice to represent it as superior, not to
that of the stability of the Earth absolutely speaking,
but to the doctrine as defended by the Peripatetics,
to whom he alludes with some contempt.</p>

<p>He adds that he will treat of three principal
heads: under the first he would show that all our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
experience was insufficient to prove conclusively
the motion of the Earth, but that it adapted itself
equally to either theory; he hoped also to produce
many observations unknown to antiquity. In the
second place, the celestial phenomena would be
examined, by which the Copernican hypothesis would
be so reinforced as if it ought to come out of the
contest absolutely victorious. In the third place he
would propound his theory about the tides: “proporrò
una fantasia ingegnosa,” he says. He had long been
of opinion that the unknown problem of the tides would
receive some light on the assumption of the Earth’s
motion. Other persons had adopted his statement on
this point as if it had been their own; he therefore
thought it desirable to expound it himself. He hints,
too, that the willingness to admit the stability of the
Earth, and to take the contrary side solely for
mathematical caprice, is partly based on piety,
religion, the knowledge of the Divine omnipotence,
and the consciousness of human weakness.</p>

<p>He had thought it well to cast these thoughts
into the form of a dialogue, which gave a certain
amount of freedom to digressions.</p>

<p>He then introduces the personages who sustain
the discussion, and who are supposed to meet at
Venice at the palace of one of their number, Sagredo
by name.</p>

<p>This preface, if one may judge by internal evidence,
was probably the joint composition of Galileo
and Father Riccardi, the former having written the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
original draft, the latter having altered the draft
and supplemented it with important additions.</p>

<p>The body of the Dialogue—which I suspect that
many persons who consider themselves competent
to give an opinion on the Galileo case have not so
much as even seen—is divided into four portions, each
being supposed to be one day’s dialogue. The interlocutors
are Salviati, Sagredo, and Simplicio. Great
offence was taken at the rôle attributed to this last-named
personage—the true doctrine put into the
mouth of a simpleton! It has been said that Pope
Urban VIII. considered it as an insult directed
against himself, because, in conversation with Galileo,
he had used some of the very arguments employed
by Simplicio. This, however, may have happened
without the author intending thereby to offer any
personal affront to His Holiness; some character was
bound to appear on the anti-Copernican side, and
it was inevitable that the arguments that Galileo
had heard, whether from ignorant or enlightened
antagonists, should be put into the mouth of such
character. The name Simplicio is of course not
meant as a compliment; moreover, he is made to
say some very unwise things, and is occasionally
treated with a sort of polite contempt by the scientific
and mathematical Salviati; and yet he is not at
all a simpleton in our sense of the word, he is
a devoted follower of Aristotle, whom he constantly
quotes, and is in fact a type—probably exaggerated—of
the school of the Peripatetics, as they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
were, and still are, called; he does not know much
of geometry or arithmetic, and so is at no small
disadvantage when arguing with Salviati, but he
is far from being a mere fool. Our author, in his
preface, introduces Salviati and Sagredo—the former
a Florentine, the latter a Venetian—as real personages,
deceased friends of his own, though this
may be a mere conventional form of expression;
but he expressly states that Simplicio is not the
true name of the “<span xml:lang="it" lang="it">buon Peripatetico</span>.”</p>

<p>The friends are supposed to meet in the palace of
Sagredo, at Venice, as before stated.</p>

<p>The first day’s dialogue deals with a good deal
of what one may term preliminary matter: that
bodies have three dimensions and no more; that
circular motion is the most perfect and the most
natural; showing by this that Galileo had not at
that time arrived at a true comprehension of the
first law of motion, as we now hold it. The motion
of weights on an inclined plane finds also a place
in the discussion; and so does what we now term
the law of accelerating force, which Galileo had
grasped so well as to be able to explain how the
velocity increases by infinitely small steps gradually,
and not, as it were, by sudden jumps.</p>

<p>Much of the matter disputed on—as, for example,
whether the heavenly bodies being incorruptible differ
in that respect from the Earth, liable as it is to
corruption and decay—which seems to us either
erroneous in conception or irrelevant to the question<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
at issue, or both—arose out of the old Aristotelian
philosophy; and in those days a dissertation which
neglected points of this kind would have been looked
upon probably with contempt, as evading subjects
that it ought to have grappled with. The distinction
between natural and artificial motion, which occurs
repeatedly in the Dialogue, is an instance of an
utterly mistaken notion, having its origin in
Aristotle, who, great philosopher though he was
in other ways, failed in his investigations of physical
science, partly from being misled by verbal fallacies.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a></p>

<p>Another point that our author endeavours to
establish in the first day’s dialogue is that the Moon
is not a polished surface, as Simplicio and others
thought, but much like our own Earth, with mountains
and plains and seas—this last being a mistake,
as subsequent observation has shown. The solar
spots are also discussed, and so, incidentally, is
the question whether the heavenly bodies are inhabited,
the affirmative opinion finding little favour
with any one.</p>

<p>During the second day the great subject is the
revolution of the Earth on its axis; and Salviati urges
forcibly the improbability of the motion of the whole
celestial sphere round the Earth in twenty-four hours,
including such a number of vast bodies, and with
such an immense velocity, while one single body<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
(the Earth), turning round on itself, would produce
the same effect. He argues also that if you believe
in this motion of the celestial sphere, you must
suppose the planets to be moving in two opposite
directions at the same time, the diurnal one from
east to west, and the annual one from west to east—using
the word <em>annual</em> in its extended sense, as
applied to the periodical revolutions of all the planets.
To this Simplicio makes the sapient answer that
Aristotle proves that circular motions are not contrary
to each other; upon which the third interlocutor,
Sagredo, asks him whether when two knights
meet one another in the open field, or two fleets at
sea—in the latter case sinking each other—such
motions can be called contrary? This Simplicio is
obliged to admit; he uses, however, another argument,
which did not seem so absurd in the then existing
state of science, namely, that there may be another
sphere beyond that of the stars, and itself starless,
to which belongs the property of the diurnal revolution,
and that this sphere may carry along with it
the inferior spheres, these latter participating in its
movement. Ideas such as these were part of the
pre-telescopic notions of astronomy. Simplicio’s
argument is in reply to some powerful reasons drawn
from the motions of the planets, the nearer revolving
in a shorter, and the more remote in a longer period;
it being extremely unlikely that they would be all
whirled round the Earth in one day; and also from
considerations connected with the stars.</p>

<p>It took a long time to disabuse the human mind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
of the antiquated opinion that the stars and planets
were set in vast movable spheres, as lamps might be
set in a large revolving cupola.</p>

<p>One of the objections made at that time against the
axial rotation of the Earth was that, if it were really
the case, any weight dropped from a high tower
would fall some way to the west of the tower, on
account of the latter having been carried on eastward
by the revolution of the Earth during the few
seconds the weight takes in falling,<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> and that such
a result was contrary to experience. In those days,
when even the first law of motion had been barely
guessed at, the second law, that of the action of combined
forces on any body, was of course not generally
understood; and a considerable debate as to this
point occurs in this same day’s dialogue. Simplicio
has the hardihood to assert that if a stone be let fall
from the mast of a vessel, the vessel being in motion,
it falls behind the mast. Salviati, after making a
foolish distinction—in accordance, however, with the
philosophical ideas then prevalent—between the
natural motion of the Earth on its axis, and the
artificial motion of the vessel, asks Simplicio if he has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
ever tried the experiment, which, of course, he had
not. He then tells him, and most truly so, that the
experiment, if made, would show a very different
result, and that the stone would fall at the foot of
the mast, whether the vessel were in motion or not.
Further on, Simplicio maintained that a projectile
thrown from the hand, according to Aristotle’s
argument, is carried on by the air, itself set in
motion by the hand of the projector; and if the
stone let fall from the mast of a ship falls at the
foot of the mast, it must be the effect of the air.
So again he imagines that a ball dropped from the
hand of a man, riding fast on horseback, falls some
way behind, and does not partake of the horse’s speed.
Salviati, however, tells him that he deceives himself,
and that experience would teach him the contrary.</p>

<p>Various difficulties are discussed in this dialogue
well known to the disputants of that day. It being
questioned why a projectile shot from a gun point-blank
towards the east does not fall above the mark
aimed at; or shot westwards fall below it? How it
is that birds, when flying, are not left behind by the
revolving Earth, since they at any rate are completely
detached from the ground above which they are soaring?
Why it is that light objects do not fly off at a tangent?</p>

<p>One sees throughout the power of the master-mind
of Galileo. He knew many things in mechanics
which no subsequent research or experiment has ever
corrected; but here and there, as may naturally be
supposed, he is at fault. It must ever be remembered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
that a dialogue, though a convenient form of
argument in some respects, does not always give one
a clear insight into the author’s real convictions.
You are not sure whether he quite agrees with any of
the spokesmen, and, indeed, Galileo, in his defence
before the Inquisition, practically assumes that he
did not so agree. It is, however, a good form of
discussion for a man whose opinions are intended to
be expressed in a <em>tentative</em> shape, and perhaps Galileo’s
mind was in a state congenial to such expression.
But, at any rate, it makes it rather more difficult
to do justice to the author, as one is never sure
what he intends to be taken as the expression of
his own deliberate belief; indeed, whatever may have
been the amount of indecision in which in this case
our author’s mind was involved, it is scarcely possible,
notwithstanding his disclaimer, to ignore the fact of
his strong Copernican opinions.</p>

<p>I think one may say that Galileo did not, at the
time when he wrote the dialogue, know the gravity of
the air. I say at that time, because it is quite
possible that he knew it before his death, since he
lived some ten or twelve years after writing this
work. It is maintained that he knew it because
there is extant a letter from Baliani, the date of
which I believe to be about 1631, in which the latter
expresses his acknowledgments to Galileo for having
taught him this truth. May it not, however, be that
what is here meant is the <em>pressure</em> of the air? If
any one thinks Galileo understood at that time the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
principle of the gravity of the atmosphere, I refer
him to the second day’s dialogue. He was aware, no
doubt, that the air was carried round by the Earth
in its diurnal motion, but why it was so carried round
I do not think he quite understood; indeed, as may
well be supposed, he did not <em>clearly</em> understand what
gravity was; it was a mysterious force, drawing
heavy bodies towards the centre of the Earth, a force
to which we, indeed, give the name of gravity, but of
the essence of which we know nothing, as, in fact, we
know nothing of the nature of the force that moves
the heavenly bodies. This passage is remarkable
because it looks as if Galileo half suspected that the
force which acted on the Moon and the planets might
be akin to that which attracted terrestrial objects
towards the centre of the Earth. If he really had
arrived at such a conclusion, he would have anticipated
the great discovery made thirty or forty years
later. I think, however, that he only wished to
illustrate the one by the other, and that the allusion
means no more. I give, however, the passage in
a note,<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> so that any reader may form his own
judgment; and I may add that according to an
opinion commonly held by the Copernican school of
that age, the adherence of the atmosphere to the
Earth as it revolved was the effect of <em>friction</em>.</p>

<p>Our philosopher, wise as he was, had not freed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
himself from the antiquated notion that some bodies
were essentially heavy and others light, which latter
had no tendency to descend; not thereby meaning
comparatively light substances, but such as were
absolutely free from the action of gravity; the fact not
being then understood that it is only the resistance of
the air that prevents the smallest feather from falling
to the ground as quickly as a cannon-shot.</p>

<p>Another mistake into which he falls is that of
maintaining, in answer to the argument that the
diurnal rotation of the Earth would cause objects to
fly off from the surface at a tangent, that <em>no amount</em>
of velocity of rotation would be sufficient for such
a result to follow; whereas, it is well known to
modern students of mechanics that if a certain very
high velocity of rotation were reached, the centrifugal
force would overcome that of gravity, and objects
would be projected from the surface of the Earth
in the direction of the tangent at that point.</p>

<p>Some irrelevant arguments occur, of which, no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
doubt, many were employed at that time on both
sides; I think it was the late Professor de Morgan
who (in an article written for a popular periodical)
made a list of these; and it must in all fairness
be said, that this circumstance ought to be taken
into account, as palliating the apparent obstinacy
of the anti-Copernican party in denying the motion
of the Earth. The argument drawn from the tides is,
of course, the most striking instance of these scientific
fallacies; but it was by no means the only one;
in this particular dialogue there is another, which
is worth noticing because it confirms what I have
just said as to Galileo knowing nothing of the
doctrine of universal gravitation. He puts into the
mouth of Salviati the argument that bodies which
emit light, as do the Sun and fixed stars, are essentially
different from those which, like the Earth and
planets, have no such property—a distinction which
modern astronomy does not endorse—and that, as
the Earth in this respect resembles the planets, and
the planets are undoubtedly moving, so probably
the Earth also is like them in motion, whilst the
Sun and the stars remain at rest. It is obvious
that ideas of this kind, however plausible they may
seem, are utterly at variance with the theory of
universal gravitation, according to which, even if
the Sun were a dark, cold body and the Earth glowing
with heat and light, the Earth would revolve about
the Sun just as it does now, <em>provided the mass of
the two bodies remained the same</em> as at present.</p>

<p>Another suggestion, and a rather amusing one, on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
the opposition side, was that all things in motion
require occasional rest, as we see to be the fact with
animals; therefore the Earth, if it were constantly
moving, would stand in need of rest—an argument,
I suppose, which needs no very elaborate answer.</p>

<p>In the third day’s dialogue a question is raised,
and sifted at great length, as to whether a certain
newly observed star in the constellation Cassiopeia
was in the firmament among the distant fixed stars,
or “sublunar,” <i>i.e.</i> nearer to the Earth than the Moon.
This star was probably the same as the very remarkable
one first observed by Tycho Brahé in 1572,
which attained a brilliancy so extraordinary, that
it is said to have been equal to the planet Venus,
and to have been visible to good eyes in full daylight;
in about a month’s time it appeared to grow smaller,
and gradually faded away until it disappeared entirely—about
six months after it was first discovered. This
was some years before the invention of the telescope,
and the observations were deprived of any assistance
they might have gained from that source. The star
was one of the most noteworthy of all the variable
stars on record.</p>

<p>There followed upon the mention of this star, a
dissertation on the method of finding the distances
of the heavenly bodies by parallax. The principle
of this method was, as we may suppose, well known
to Galileo; but he probably did not allow <em>sufficiently</em>
for the great difficulty in taking accurate observations,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
especially with the imperfect instruments
then in use; I say sufficiently, because that there
were such errors he knew, and he insists on the fact
in the Dialogue.</p>

<p>Much discourse is spent on the distance of this
new star; the apparent reason of which is that it
had created some sensation among the astronomers
of that day, and therefore the subject received an
attention out of proportion to its real importance—I
mean importance so far as the Copernican controversy
was concerned.</p>

<p>The conversation is then brought back to the
objections made by contemporary philosophers to the
Copernican system. Aristotle’s idea of the universe
was that of a vast sphere, or number of concentric
hollow spheres, with the Earth in the centre; if that
were shown to be probably untrue, his system broke
down.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> Coming, however, to our own immediate
portion of the universe, the question is now raised
whether the Earth or the Sun is the centre of revolution.
Galileo, by the mouth of Salviati, explains
forcibly the argument for the Sun being so. That
Mercury and Venus revolve round the Sun he takes
for certain; the phases of Venus, which he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
himself observed, proved it as regards that planet;
and the fact of neither of these bodies ever being
seen far apart from the Sun, greatly strengthened
the conclusion in respect of both of them. A transit
of Mercury over the Sun’s disc had, in fact, been
observed in the year 1631, by Gassendi; but Galileo
was doubtless not aware of it when he wrote the
Dialogue.</p>

<p>It being clear then that Venus and Mercury revolve
round the Sun, Galileo shows what strong ground
there is for inferring that the superior planets, Mars,
Jupiter, and Saturn (the others not being then
known), do so also; this he judges from the greater
size of these latter, and particularly of Mars, when in
opposition than when in conjunction; whence we
may conclude that the Earth, which as well as the Sun
is contained within their orbits, is not in the centre of
them, or nearly so. It is remarkable that Galileo
treats all the planets as revolving in <em>circles</em>, though
one would think he must at that time have been
aware of Kepler’s discovery—that they move in
<em>ellipses</em>. He makes Simplicio grant these last-mentioned
points, which is curious; and he also
explains how the telescope showed phenomena, such
as the phases of Venus, which were unknown to
Copernicus. Simplicio has hitherto had no confidence
in this new instrument, and following in the footsteps
of his friends the Peripatetic philosophers, has supposed
the appearances in question to be optical
illusions arising from the lenses used; he will, however,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
gladly be corrected if in error. Simplicio’s mathematical
acquirements are not very great, and it is necessary
to explain to him that the areas of circles vary in
proportion, not to their diameters simply but to the
squares of the diameters, a point which arises in
reference to the false judgment formed by the naked
eye as to the size of the celestial bodies, an error
which is corrected by the telescope. Then to those
who made it a difficulty that the Earth should move
round the Sun, not alone, but accompanied by the
Moon, Salviati is made to reply that Jupiter revolves
round the Sun accompanied by four moons.</p>

<p>Again the greater simplicity of the Copernican
theory, in accounting for the planetary motions, as
they appear to us, is expounded by the same
personage.</p>

<p>Galileo occasionally makes the interlocutors allude
to himself as “<span xml:lang="it" lang="it">il nostro amico comune</span>,” “il nostro
Accademico Linceo,” etc., and thus claims credit for
having been the first to discover the solar spots, a
credit which ought not to belong exclusively to him,
as Fabricius and the Jesuit Father Scheiner saw the
spots at about the same time.</p>

<p>An argument is here attempted to be drawn in
favour of the Earth’s annual motion from the apparent
course of the Sun-spots, and the curves they sometimes
describe (as viewed from hence), owing to the
inclination of the Sun’s axis to an axis perpendicular
to the plane of the ecliptic—an inclination of about
7°; there is nothing, however, at all conclusive in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
such argument, because the appearances in question
result from the different <em>relative</em> positions of the Earth
and Sun at different seasons of the year, and would
be the same whichever of the two bodies were in
motion.</p>

<p>There follows some conversation arising from one of
the anti-Copernican books of that day; one of the
difficulties suggested, being the vast distance at which
you must suppose the fixed stars to be placed, if
Copernicus be right. We who are accustomed to the
idea of these immense distances, can scarcely understand
the prejudices of the philosophers of that age
against admitting them. And it is worth noting that
Galileo takes for granted, while answering these
theoretical objections, the calculation of his predecessors—that
the distance of the Sun is that of 1,208
semi-diameters of the Earth, that is something more
than 4,800,000 miles, about one-nineteenth part of
what we now know it to be. So also he supposes the
size of the Sun to be much less than what is really
the case. He was also under the erroneous impression,
arising doubtless from the imperfection of the instruments
he used, that the stars really had an apparent
diameter, though less than Tycho Brahé and other
astronomers had supposed, and estimates the angular
diameter of a star of the first magnitude at about
5″; consequently he imagined the stars to be
much nearer than is actually the fact. It is well
known to modern observers, that the apparent size of
a star is the effect of an optical illusion, and that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
greatly as the stars vary in brightness, they present
no appreciable diameter at all to the eye; not even
those classed as being of the first magnitude.</p>

<p>Another and more weighty objection to Copernicus
is, however, urged by the mouth of Simplicio, and it
is this—if the Earth really makes an annual revolution
round the Sun, why do not the fixed stars,
viewed as they must be at different seasons of the
year from points so widely distant, change their
apparent positions in the heavens? We have just
seen that the true distance of the Sun was not known
at that time;—if it had been known, and if the men
of that age had been aware that the diameter of the
Earth’s orbit was about 184,000,000 miles in length,
the objection would have been still more forcible.
But the modern answer to it is conclusive: the stars,
or rather a certain number of them, do actually undergo
a small displacement in their apparent position every
year, or in the technical language of astronomy, they
have an annual parallax, a fact which not merely
disposes of the objection, but actually confirms the
truth of the Copernican theory.</p>

<p>Galileo’s reply (by the mouth of Salviati) is to the
effect that the followers of Ptolemy admit that it
takes 36,000 years to effect a complete revolution
of the starry sphere; then, judging from the planets,
the length of time required for the orbit is in proportion
to the distance, and we suppose the distance of the
starry sphere to be, on such assumption, 10,800 semi-diameters
of the Earth’s orbit (or Sun’s orbit, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
they called it). At so great a distance as that,
the change of position caused by the Earth’s annual
motion round the Sun would not be appreciable.</p>

<p>The principle of this reply is of course quite sound,
and we, who know the stars to be considerably farther
from us than the above estimate supposes, can well
understand that the vast majority of them have no
annual parallax whatever, that the finest instruments
can discover.</p>

<p>To further objections drawn from the enormous
distances of the stars, and the difficulty of perceiving
the use which such remote bodies can be to the
Earth, it is replied that such speculations are useless
and presumptuous, and also that words like small,
very small, immense, etc., are relative rather than
absolute.</p>

<p>Some pains are taken in the course of the dialogue
to explain how the stars, according to their different
positions, would be affected by annual parallax,
supposing such to be discoverable, and assuming the
motion of the Earth. And a minute explanation is
also given, on this latter assumption, of the length
of day and night varying in different latitudes
according to the seasons; illustrating the fact that
details which appear to us elementary and are
taught to schoolboys, were strange to the minds
even of educated and learned men in those days.</p>

<p>One remark, arising from the questions connected
with stellar parallax, is most striking, as showing how
far Galileo was advanced in his knowledge of pure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
mathematics as well as of mechanics and astronomy.
Salviati is made to say that the circumference of
an infinite circle is identical with a straight line:
“<span xml:lang="it" lang="it">sono l’istessa cosa</span>.” This idea, familiar though
it be to modern mathematicians, is one that we
should not have expected to find enunciated in
the early part of the seventeenth century; even
the intelligent Sagredo cannot understand or believe
it, and it is not further discussed; but the fact
of its being here stated is especially noteworthy.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a></p>

<p>Another (less felicitous) guess is hazarded by the
same interlocutor Salviati, who, as I have already
remarked, appears to be the one that most nearly
represents the author’s own mind,—to account for
the Earth keeping her axis pointed (approximately,
that is to say) in the same direction during each
annual revolution round the Sun. Salviati suggests
that it may be due to some magnetic influence,
and that the interior of the Earth may be a vast
loadstone. This is strange, because it is evident
from what immediately preceded, that the author
was aware of the true reason, which in fact he
illustrates by the well-known experiment of a light
ball floating in a bucket of water, to which a revolving
motion is imparted. It seems, however, that
a work by William Gilbert on the subject of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
magnetism had had some influence on the scientific
thought of the period, and that Galileo had considered
it worthy of his attention. The writer had
maintained the probability of this theory, of the
Earth’s interior being an enormous loadstone—not
an unnatural idea in the then-existing state of
science—and Galileo was evidently somewhat fascinated
by the hypothesis. Magnetism was attracting
the notice of the philosophers of that day, and
the property of the needle, which is termed the <em>dip</em>,
had been recently discovered.</p>

<p>There is not much else worthy of special mention
in the third day’s dialogue; which in fact, as a whole,
is not equal to that of the second day.</p>

<p>The fourth day is mainly devoted to the argument
drawn from the tides. It was in handling this branch
of the subject that Galileo’s great sagacity and power
of discernment seem to have deserted him. It is a
curious thing that the inhabitant of a Mediterranean
country, who, for all that one knows, never saw a
really great tide in his life, should have seized upon
this topic, and so utterly misused and perverted it.</p>

<p>If, instead of living in Italy, he had resided at an
English seaport, he would probably have never fallen
into the mistakes he thus made. In the Mediterranean
there are currents, arising from other causes, which he,
however, attributed to tidal action; but for the most
part there is little, if any, appreciable ebb and flow of
the tides, scarcely any perceptible rise and fall of the
sea, a fact which he particularly notices. But in some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
few places, and notably at Venice, there is a sensible
tide, so it is said, causing a difference of a few feet
between high and low water.</p>

<p>Now Galileo was under the impression that the ebb
and flow took each about six hours, following the
ordinary solar day; whereas, if he had observed the
phenomenon on the shores of any sea, where the tidal
wave of the ocean made its full force to be felt, or
again, at the mouth of a great tidal river, he never
could have failed to perceive that the rise and fall of
the water follow approximately the <em>lunar</em>, and not
the solar day, the former being fifty minutes longer
than the latter. It must of course be understood that
the theory of the tides was first investigated fully
and scientifically by the same great genius to
whom we owe the theory of universal gravitation;
and Galileo, who lived half a century earlier, may well
be excused for not having grasped it. But it had
long been known that the Sun and Moon had an
influence upon the tides, and as I have just stated,
any one who watched the movements of the sea from
day to day, and from week to week, at a place where
there is a great rise and fall—as for instance, in the
Bristol Channel—could not fail to perceive that the
Moon had the principal share in the work, however
unable he might be to comprehend the theory.
Besides which, the theory, however obvious to us (at
least in its main outlines), was not by any means so
intelligible to the men of Galileo’s age. They might
just guess that the Sun exercised some attractive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
influence over the Earth, and the Earth again over the
Moon, but they did not know that the Moon attracted
the Earth exactly in the same way, though with far
inferior potency, owing to her much smaller mass;
and consequently they were not aware of the Moon’s
power to raise the great tidal wave in the ocean, to
which are due the remarkable phenomena so familiar
to the inhabitants of the English coasts.</p>

<p>Galileo would have been wise if he had not touched
on a point which he neither understood in theory, nor
had properly acquainted himself with by practical observation.
Good causes are often damaged by bad arguments,
and such was the case on this occasion.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> There
was, however, something ingenious in his argument.
If you take a basin of water, and move it along quite
smoothly and evenly, no great commotion in the
water takes place; but suppose some stoppage or
jerk to occur, the result will be, as we know, very
different. Now the Earth has two motions, one
round its axis in twenty-four hours, and the other
round the Sun in one year; every point, then, on the
Earth’s surface moves through space more rapidly
while on that side of the globe which is turned away<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
from the Sun, than on that side which by the diurnal
revolution is turned round in the contrary direction.
Here, then, with the sea lying in its vast basin, and
revolving with other things on the surface of the
Earth from west to east every day, and thus accelerated
in its motion through space during twelve
hours and retarded during the other twelve hours,
you have on a large scale the same result that a
basin, half full of water, held in your hands and
checked by some retarding obstacle, gives you on
a very small and minute scale. Strange indeed it is
that a man who was acquainted with the laws of
motion sufficiently to know that anything thrown or
dropped in a vessel or a vehicle, partook of the
motion of the latter and followed its course (so long
as it remained within the vehicle) just as if the whole
were at rest—that he should have failed to perceive
that the ocean, lying in its bed in that mighty
vehicle the Earth, would be carried round in the
daily rotation with an uniform velocity, unless
interfered with by the attraction of other bodies.
Simplicio, who for once is right, puts the difficulty,
that if the sea behaved in the way supposed, the
air would do so in the same way: the reply to which
is that the air being thin and light is less adherent
to the Earth than the water which is heavier, and
does not accommodate itself to the Earth’s movements
as water does; further, that where the air is not
hemmed in, as it were, by mountains and other
inequalities on the Earth’s surface, it really is partially<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
left behind by the diurnal rotation, and in the neighbourhood
of the tropics, where the effect is chiefly
felt, a constant wind blows accordingly from east to
west. Our philosopher had evidently heard of the
trade winds, though he had not acquired an accurate
knowledge of their course or of their origin. It
is undoubtedly true that they do help strongly
to prove the revolution of the Earth, because they
arise from cold currents of air flowing in from
the north and from the south respectively towards
the tropics, to supply the place of the atmosphere
rarefied by the sun’s heat, and consequently
ascending, as is the case in those regions. Then
these cold currents, coming from latitudes where
there is a less velocity of rotation, tend to preserve
that velocity and lag behind the Earth as it revolves,
so that they have the effect of north-easterly winds
in the northern hemisphere, and south-easterly in the
southern hemisphere. Galileo’s imperfect information
prevented him from using this important argument.</p>

<p>However, to return to the tides. He had to
account for other phenomena, besides the daily rise
and fall, namely, for the much greater rise and fall
which take place soon after new and full moon, and
which are known as the spring-tides. Unable to
deny that these were in some way due to lunar
influence, he took refuge in the supposition that the
Moon, when at the full, retarded the motion of the
Earth in its orbit, since as the two travel together round
the Sun at those particular times, they form, as it were,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
a lengthened pendulum, longer than at other times
by the semi-diameter of the lunar orbit; and therefore
(like any other pendulum) must vibrate more slowly.
I should say that he does not appear to have been
aware of the existence of <em>two</em> spring-tides in each
lunation, and therefore only tries to account for one;
and it is obvious that this method of explaining
them is not only utterly inadequate, but even absurd.
The Moon truly enough exercises a certain disturbing
influence on the orbital motion of the Earth, but that
has nothing to do with the spring-tides.</p>

<p>There remained the necessity of accounting for the
annual, or, more properly, semi-annual increase of the
ebb and flow of the sea. Galileo suggests that this
arises from the angle made by the plane of the
equator with the ecliptic at the equinoxes, owing to
which there would not be the same counteraction
exercised by the Earth’s motion in its orbit on the
waters of the ocean at those periods as there would
at the solstices. But it seems that this would rather
tend to diminish the tides than to increase them, as,
indeed, would be the case as regards the last-mentioned
explanation with respect to the ordinary
spring-tides. What really does happen at the equinoxes
is, that the Sun and the full or new Moon
being at those times vertical to the equator (or nearly
so), they have a greater attractive force than at other
spring-tides over the vast expanse of the ocean, and
the tides are consequently greater. There is also
another increase which sometimes occurs when the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
Moon happens to be at its least distance from the
Earth at the time of spring-tides, but that was unknown
to Galileo. He touches, however, and very
properly so, on the great modifications in the tides
caused by various gulfs, by the forms of the great
continents, and the shapes of different seas—modifications,
in fact, which are well known to be almost
innumerable, and have been learnt only by careful
observation and experience.</p>

<p>One of the worst features of this Dialogue is the
contempt which the author shows for those opinions
on the subject which differ from his own; and it is
difficult to suppress a feeling of disgust when he
alludes in this way to Kepler, who had partly guessed
the true cause of the tides, and of whom he otherwise
speaks in terms of respect.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a></p>

<p>If a man of science, when he wishes to publish to
the world a discovery or a hypothesis, adopts the
form of a dialogue as a method of stating his case,
he ought in all reason to do full justice to the antagonistic
side, and state his opponent’s case as well as
his own. I fear that Galileo failed to do this, not
only in this particular dialogue, but also to some
extent in those of the three preceding days. Simplicio,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
as I said above, is not a fool, but as a
personage in a scientific argument he is lamentably
deficient.</p>

<p>Simplicio at the end of the Dialogue urges that God
could, in His infinite power, cause the tides by some
other means than those suggested by Salviati, to
which true and pious (though, perhaps, rather irrelevant)
argument the latter respectfully and devoutly
assents.</p>

<p>The concluding sentences are said, as I have remarked
elsewhere, to have been recast or retouched
by Father Riccardi.</p>

<p>It is worth noticing that there is a passage in the
fourth day’s dialogue, in which the author alludes to
the fact of the Sun being apparently longer by about
nine days in passing along the ecliptic from the
spring to the autumn equinox, than in passing from
the autumnal to the vernal; that is to say, of the
northern hemisphere having so much longer summer
than winter, and he treats it as one of the recondite
problems of astronomy not as yet understood. This
is an additional proof that for some reason or another
he had not made himself acquainted with Kepler’s
researches; for as soon as it became known that the
planets move, not in circles, but in ellipses, with the
Sun in one of the foci, it was obvious that there
would be in every case (though in some more than
others) this inequality to which allusion has been
made, and the Earth, if a planet, would be subject to
the same rule as the rest.</p>

<p>Such, then, is a somewhat imperfect <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">précis</i> of this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
famous work of Galileo, which owes its importance
to the historical circumstances connected with its
publication quite as much, to say the least of it, as
to its own intrinsic merit.</p>

</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">Resuming</span> the history of events, we find that early
in the year 1632 the printing of the Dialogue was
completed. The author caused some copies to be
bound and gilt and sent to Rome. It was not easy to
pass them, on account of the quarantine; yet some
amongst them found their way, and great was the
sensation caused in the ecclesiastical world by their
appearance.</p>

<p>There were a few admirers of Galileo who approved
warmly; but there was the School of Aristotle, as in
these enlightened days there is the School of Darwin,<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a>
and they could not bear that anything should be published
reflecting on the scientific infallibility of their
great philosopher. Thus we find that Father Scheiner,
writing to Gassendi, observed that Galileo had
written his work “<cite xml:lang="la" lang="la">contra communem Peripateticorum
Scholam</cite>.”</p>

<p>The agitation against the book was successful, and
a report arose forthwith that it would be condemned.
The report was no mere <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">canard</i>, as the subsequent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
proceedings soon showed. In the month of August of
this same year the Master of the Sacred Palace gave
orders to the printer at Florence to suspend the distribution
of the copies, and he also sent for those
which had been brought to Rome. Nor was this all.
In the following month the Pope ordered that a letter
should be written to the Inquisitor of Florence, enjoining
him to direct Galileo to present himself in
Rome in the month of October, in order to explain his
conduct.</p>

<p>The book had already been examined by special
Commission—a step taken with the view of pleasing
the Grand Duke of Tuscany, so as to avoid bringing
the affair before the Inquisition.</p>

<p>The Pope, from whatever cause, was much displeased.
This appeared in a conversation with
Niccolini, the Tuscan Ambassador, in which His Holiness
said that Galileo had entered on ground which
he ought not to have touched, and that both Ciampoli
and the Master of the Sacred Palace had been deceived.
Still it seemed that, so far, there was no
intention to do more than censure the book and
demand a retractation.</p>

<p>The special Commission, of which mention has just
been made, after a month’s interval, reported that
Galileo had been disobedient to orders in the following
respects: Affirming as an absolute truth the
movement of the Earth instead of stating it as a hypothesis;
attributing the tides to this cause—<i>i.e.</i> to
the revolution and movement of the Earth; deceitfully
keeping silence as to the order given him in 1616 to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
abandon the opinion that the Earth revolved, and that
the Sun was the centre of the universe.</p>

<p>Another memorial (drawn up about the same time),
after enumerating the facts of the case, stated eight
heads of accusation against the philosopher:</p>

<blockquote class="hang">

<p>1.—Having, without leave, placed at the beginning
of his work the permission for printing,
delivered at Rome.</p>

<p>2.—Having, in the body of the work, put the true
doctrine in the mouth of a fool, and having
approved it but feebly by the argument of
another interlocutor.</p>

<p>3.—Having quitted the region of hypothesis by
affirming, in an absolute manner, the mobility
of the Earth and the stability of the Sun, etc.</p>

<p>4.—Having treated the subject as one that was not
already decided, and in the attitude of a
person waiting for a definition, and supposing
it to have not been yet promulgated.</p>

<p>5.—Having despised the authors who were opposed
to the above-mentioned opinion, though the
Church uses them in preference to others.</p>

<p>6.—Having affirmed (untruly) the equality supposed
to exist, for understanding geometrical
matters, between the divine and
human intellect.</p>

<p>7.—Having stated, as a truth, that the partisans of
Ptolemy ought to range themselves with those
of Copernicus, and denied the converse.</p>

<p>8.—Having wrongly attributed the tides to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
stability of the Sun and mobility of the
Earth, which things do not exist.</p></blockquote>

<p>It must be observed that all this was merely of the
nature of an accusation, and was in no way an ecclesiastical
decision.</p>

<p>It appears, too, that some apprehensions were entertained
in Rome that false philosophical and theological
doctrines might be drawn out of the opinion
put forth by Galileo. No. 6 of the above-mentioned
accusations points in that direction.</p>

<p>At any rate, no time was lost in summoning the
philosopher to Rome, there to answer for his offences.
A message to that effect was communicated to him by
the Inquisitor at Florence, on the 1st October. Upon
this, Galileo, anxious to gain time, and to excuse
himself from going to Rome, if it were possible to
do so, wrote to Cardinal Barberini, and sought the
powerful advocacy of the Grand Duke of Tuscany;
he urged his infirm health, and advanced age, nearly
seventy years, as grounds for consideration. It was
intimated to him, however, that although some little
time would be allowed him on the ground of health,
yet to Rome he must come; and a threat was added,
through the Inquisitor at Florence, of bringing him
fettered as a prisoner if it turned out that his health
was not really such as he represented it to be. So at
last he yielded, and started for Rome on the 20th
January, 1633, and, travelling very slowly, arrived<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
on the 13th February, when the Tuscan Ambassador,
Niccolini, who had sent his litter for him, received
him at his Palace. This, with all the freedom it
implied, was indeed an unusual indulgence to persons
situated as he was. After a short time, during which
no official steps were taken, he was conveyed to the
office of the Inquisition, and lodged there, but well
and commodiously, by the Pope’s order.</p>

<p>On the 12th April he appeared for the first time
before the Court; he admitted the authorship of the
Dialogue; he admitted, too, that the decree of the
Index had been notified to him; but stated that
Cardinal Bellarmine had informed him that it was
allowable to hold the Copernican doctrine as a
hypothesis. He maintained further that he had not
contravened the order given him, that he should
not defend or support this doctrine; and he declared
that he did not remember having been forbidden
in any way to teach it.</p>

<p>It would seem that this latter prohibition was
meant to include teaching by implication, such as
one may do through the medium of an interlocutor in
a dialogue.</p>

<p>It is startling that Galileo should have said among
other things on this occasion, that he had not embraced
or defended in his book the opinion that the
Earth is in motion and the Sun stationary; but, on
the contrary, had shown that the reasons produced
by Copernicus were feeble and inconclusive.</p>

<p>After this examination he was well lodged, though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
treated as a prisoner, being placed in the apartments
of the “Fiscal of the Holy Office,” instead of in the
ordinary chambers appropriated to accused persons;
moreover, he had leave to walk in the garden, and
was attended by his own servant. He said himself,
in a letter to his friend Bocchineri, that his health
was good, and that he had every attention shown to
him by the Tuscan Ambassador and Ambassadress.
It is well to note these things, because they dispose
of the popular accusations of cruelty which have been
made by ignorant or malicious controversialists,
although the antagonists with whom I am dealing
are too well informed to resort to them.</p>

<p>A slight indisposition from which our philosopher
suffered about this time, illustrated still further the
desire which existed to treat him with <em>personal</em>
kindness; the Commissary and the Fiscal charged
with the process, both visited him and spoke encouragingly
to him. As soon as he had recovered
he requested to have a further hearing. This took
place on the 30th April; but meanwhile, three
theologians, who had been consulted, Augustin Orezzi,
Melchior Inchofer, and Zacharias Pasqualigo, had
each separately presented a memorial to the effect
that Galileo had taught in his book the motion of
the Earth and the immobility of the Sun. At the
hearing on the 30th April, being asked to say whatever
occurred to him, he stated that he had read his
Dialogue again—not having seen it for three years
previously—in order to ascertain if there was anything—“<span xml:lang="it" lang="it">se<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
contro alla mia purissima intenzione, per
mia inavertenza</span>”—by which he had been at all
disobedient to the order imposed on him in 1616;
and he had found there were some arguments, notably
about the solar spots and the tides, which he had
put too forcibly, and which he thought could be
refuted. As regards the latter of these two points
we may, I think, cordially agree with him in his
retractation: but it had been a favourite argument
with him. He also stated on this occasion—not
having, I fear, the courage of his convictions—that
he had not held as true the condemned opinion
as to the Earth’s motion, and was ready to write
something fresh in order to refute it, if the time
to do so were allowed him.</p>

<p>On this same day (30th April) the Commissary-General
of the Inquisition, with the Pope’s sanction,
allowed Galileo to be imprisoned, under certain conditions,
at the Palace of the Tuscan Ambassador, this
favour being conceded on account of his age and
health.</p>

<p>He was again called before the Court on the 10th
May, and he then presented a written statement, to
which was appended the original of Cardinal Bellarmine’s
injunction, laid on him in 1616. It contained
certain prohibitions, but not the word “teach.”</p>

<p>He pleaded also that he had done his best to avoid
all fault in his book, which he had himself submitted
to the Grand Inquisitor. Now follows what seems
like more severe treatment, whether because he had not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
impressed his judges with a belief in his candour and
sincerity, or from other reasons. However, the Pope,
on the 16th June, gave orders that he should be
questioned as to his <em>intention</em>; then, after he had
been <em>threatened</em> with torture (apparently without any
view of putting the threat into execution), and made
to pronounce an abjuration full and entire, that he
should be condemned to prison according to the
discretion of the Inquisition; also that his treatise
should be prohibited, and himself forbidden to treat,
either by word or writing, on the subject of the Sun
and the Earth.</p>

<p>Yet, with all this, the Pope, two days afterwards,
said to Niccolini, the Tuscan Ambassador, that it was
impossible not to prohibit this opinion (Copernicanism)
as it was contrary to the Holy Scriptures, and that
Galileo must remain a prisoner for some time for
having contravened the orders given him in 1616,
but that he (the Pope) would see if the condemnation
could be mitigated.</p>

<p>It appears that he was thinking of sentencing him
to a temporary seclusion in the Monastery of Santa
Croce, at Florence.</p>

<p>When, in pursuance of the Pope’s order, Galileo
was questioned (21st June), he was asked how long
it was since he had held the opinion that the Sun,
and not the Earth, was the centre of the universe;
to which he replied that long before the decree of
1616 he held that the two opinions could equally be
sustained; but that since the decree, convinced as he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
was of the prudence of the superior authorities, all
uncertainty in his mind had ceased, that he had then
adopted, and still held, the opinion of Ptolemy on
the mobility of the Sun as true and indubitable.
Certain passages in his book were then put to him
as being irreconcilable with the statements he was
making; and yet he maintained that, though he had
stated the case <em>pro</em> and <em>con</em> in his work, he did not,
in his heart, hold the condemned opinion. “<span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Concludo
dunque dentro di me medesimo ne tenere ne haver
tenuto dopo la determinazione delli Superiori la
dannata opinione.</span>”</p>

<p>Threatened with torture if he did not tell the
truth, he persevered in his answer as already given;
upon which the tribunal, after making him sign his
deposition, dismissed him. On the next day, the
22nd June, he was taken to Santa Maria Sopra
Minerva, and brought before the Cardinals and Prelates
of the Congregation, that he might hear his
sentence and pronounce his abjuration.</p>

<p>The accusation was that he had openly violated the
order given him not to maintain Copernicanism; that
he had unfairly extorted permission to print his book,
without showing the prohibition received in 1616;
that he had maintained the condemned opinion,
although he alleged that he had left it undecided and
as simply probable—which, however, was still a grave
error, since an opinion declared contrary to Scripture
could not in any way be probable.</p>

<p>His sentence was to the effect that he had rendered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
himself strongly suspected of heresy in believing and
maintaining a doctrine false and opposed to Holy
Scripture in respect of the motion of the Sun and
the Earth, and in believing that one might maintain
and defend any opinion after it had been declared to
be contrary to Holy Scripture. He had, therefore,
incurred the censures in force against those who
offend in such ways; from which, however, he would
be absolved provided that, with a sincere heart and
unfeigned faith, he would abjure the said errors and
heresies; but, as a penance and as a warning to
others, he was to undergo certain inflictions. The
book was henceforth to be prohibited, he himself was
to be condemned to the ordinary prison of the Holy
Office for a time the Holy Office would itself limit,
and he was to recite the seven Penitential Psalms
once a week for three years. The Holy Office
reserved to itself the power to remit or change part
or all of the above-named penances. Galileo abjured,
accordingly, as directed.</p>

<p>The well-known legend that after his abjuration
he stamped on the ground with his foot, saying:
“<span xml:lang="it" lang="it">E pur si muove</span>” (And yet it, <i>i.e.</i> the Earth, <em>does</em>
move), is not found in any contemporary author,
and first appears towards the end of the eighteenth
century. It is also to the last degree improbable;
Galileo was in far too great dread of his judges
to provoke them by openly perpetrating such an
action; and if he did it <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">sotto voce</i>, who heard it,
and who testified to it? The late Dr. Whewell in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
his “History of the Inductive Sciences,” suggests
that it was “uttered as a playful epigram in the
ear of a Cardinal’s secretary, with a full knowledge
that it would be immediately repeated to his master.”
This writer is eminently fair, though naturally he
writes from a Protestant point of view; but he takes
the extraordinary line of maintaining what I think
no one who knows all the facts could possibly
suppose, namely, that the whole thing was a kind
of solemn farce, and that the Inquisitors did not
believe Galileo’s abjuration to be sincere, or even
wish it to be so; thus he says: “though we may
acquit the Popes and Cardinals of Galileo’s time
of stupidity and perverseness in rejecting manifest
scientific truths, I do not see how we can acquit
them of dissimulation and duplicity.” That is, he
thinks the process was a piece of decorous solemnity,
adopted to hoodwink the ecclesiastical public. I do
not think it necessary to discuss so improbable a
theory. And the story of “<span xml:lang="it" lang="it">E pur si muove</span>,” as
also that of bodily torture or any personal cruelty
being inflicted on Galileo, may, I venture to think,
be dismissed into the realm of fable.</p>

<p>The Pope, without delay, commuted the sentence
of imprisonment to one of seclusion in the Palace
of the Tuscan Ambassador, on the Monte Pincio,
after which Galileo was allowed to retire to Sienna,
to the Palace of the Archbishop of that place,
Piccolomini, one of his warmest friends, from whom
he received every possible attention. Indeed, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
Archbishop seems to have gone beyond the limits
of prudence, considering the peculiar circumstances
of the case and the temper of the times, in the
enthusiasm of his admiration for the great astronomer,
and to have hinted to various persons that,
in his opinion, he had been unjustly condemned,
that he was the greatest man in the world and
would always live in his writings, even those that
had been prohibited; such, at least, was the report
that found its way to Rome, and it caused great
prejudice to Galileo. He had received permission
to go to his country house at Arcetri, near Florence,
on condition that he lived there quietly, receiving
only the visits of his friends and relatives, in such
a way as not to give umbrage; and the report, to
which allusion has just been made, coupled with
the accusation that, under the encouragement of his
host the Archbishop, he had spread opinions that
were not soundly Catholic in the city of Sienna,
caused some additional strictness to be enforced as
to the manner of his seclusion.</p>

<p>Thus he was detained for four years in his villa,
and was refused permission to go to Florence for
medical treatment, it being, however, apparent that
the villa was sufficiently near to the city to enable
physicians and surgeons to go <em>to him</em> when required.
Later on, in 1638, when his sufferings had increased,
and he had become (wholly or partially) blind, permission
was given him to reside in Florence, on
condition that he should not speak to his visitors<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
on the subject of the movement of the Earth. Of
this concession he availed himself, and lived for his
few remaining years in Florence, occupying himself
with scientific pursuits. In this same year he
published at Leyden a work entitled, “<cite xml:lang="it" lang="it">Dialoghi
delle Nuove Scienze</cite>”; this, in fact, was his last
work of importance, and he died on the 8th
January, 1642, in his seventy-eighth year.</p>

<p>It is not easy to form an accurate estimate of
the character of Galileo, so far, at least, as affected
by the proceedings just related. By some he has
been called a “Martyr of Science”; but a martyr,
unless the word be used in a loose and inaccurate
sense, ought, above all things, to have the courage
of his convictions, and as we have seen, that was
hardly the case with Galileo. I will here again
quote Dr. Whewell’s work on the “<cite>History of the
Inductive Sciences</cite>,” and this time in agreement
with his words: “I do not see with what propriety
Galileo can be looked upon as a martyr of science.
Undoubtedly he was very desirous of promoting what
he conceived to be the cause of philosophical truth;
but it would seem that, while he was restless and
eager in urging his opinions, he was always ready
to make such submissions as the spiritual tribunals
required.... But in this case (<i>i.e.</i> the case of his
refusing to abjure) he would have been a martyr
to a cause of which the merit was of a mingled
character; for his own special and favourite share
in the reasonings by which the Copernican system<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
was supported, was the argument drawn from the
flux and reflux of the sea, which argument is
altogether false.”</p>

<p>Yet though we deny him the credit of having
been a hero or a martyr, we must not be too severe
in condemning him. He was old and enfeebled
by bad health; moreover, his friends had advised
him to submit fully and unreservedly to the tribunal
of the Inquisition. And to this we may add the
following considerations. There can be little doubt
that he held the Copernican theory as a very probable
opinion; how, indeed, with his knowledge of astronomy,
and with his own discoveries before his eyes,
could it be otherwise? But it is very possible
that he had no fixed, absolute conviction on the
subject; he was a sincere Catholic, and had a deep
respect for the Pope and for the Church, and, unlike
modern scientific men, he probably allowed some
weight to the decisions of ecclesiastical authorities.
Remembering all this, we may well admit that there
is much to palliate his conduct, though not fully
to justify it.</p>

<p>But his want of candour evidently prejudiced his
judges against him. They accepted his reiterated
denials of belief, even a qualified belief, in Copernicanism,
but they did not credit them as being
true. I incline to hold that he would have done
as well and given more satisfaction to the tribunal
if he had made a straightforward defence in some
such way as this: that he could not help believing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
Copernicanism to be a probable hypothesis on purely
scientific grounds, and <em>more than this</em>, the then-existing
state of astronomical knowledge would not
have justified him in saying: that he left to the
ecclesiastical authorities henceforth the entire question
of reconciling the theory with Holy Scripture,
and that he would not in future teach it even as a
hypothesis, or publish any work so teaching it,
without permission. A statement of this nature,
coupled with an apology for any indiscretion connected
with the publication of the Dialogue, might
have availed him better than the line he adopted,
and would at least have had the merit of candour.</p>

<p>A few words may here be added on the scientific
character of Galileo; in this respect he was, with
the exception of Kepler, the first man of his age.</p>

<p>He has the credit of being the discoverer of the
first law of motion; but whether he fully realised
this all-important law, or whether it was one of
those happy guesses which we sometimes find to
have been made by men who are the precursors of
great discoverers, but who do not perceive the full
scope and the ultimate bearing of the truths on
which they have lighted, I need not here discuss.
He did, however, state the law in a Dialogue on
mechanics, published in 1638, in these words:</p>

<p>“I imagine a movable body projected in a horizontal
plane, all impediments [to motion] being
removed; it is then manifest from what has been
said more fully elsewhere, that its (the body’s) motion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
will be uniform and perpetual upon the plane, if
the plane be extended to infinity.”</p>

<p>This of course involves the principle of the first
of the three laws of motion, the Newtonian laws,
as they are frequently called, because the man whose
name they bear was the one who used them clearly
and consistently as the basis of a great astronomical
theory. The law, as now usually stated, is fuller
and more explicit than that given by Galileo, and
may be enunciated thus: “Every body perseveres
in its state of rest, or of uniform motion in a straight
line, unless it is compelled to change that state by
forces impressed on it.”</p>

<p>It is, however, greatly to the scientific credit of
Galileo that before the close of his life he should
have emancipated himself from the erroneous idea
that circular motion alone is naturally uniform, and
should have stated in the language just quoted the
true mechanical doctrine, unknown to his predecessors,
unknown even to Kepler, a doctrine which
involved nothing less than a revolution in the conception
of the laws of motion. Nor was this his
only contribution to the science of mechanics; he
it was who first understood the law that regulates
the velocity of falling bodies; he perceived that
they were acted upon by an uniformly accelerating
force, that of terrestrial gravity, and that the velocity
at any given point is proportional to the time of
descent.</p>

<p>The principle of virtual velocities is said by some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
persons to have been discovered by Galileo, and it
appears that he stated it fully and clearly; but he
can scarcely be said to be the discoverer of it, as it
had been known to others, and had even—at least as
exemplified in the case of the lever—been noticed by
Aristotle. There is, however, no doubt that Galileo
was the greatest man of his day in mechanical knowledge,
whether we attribute more or less weight to
the light he threw on particular details.</p>

<p>In astronomy he was necessarily a discoverer, for the
all-important reason that, as already stated, he was
the first man that ever used the telescope for investigating
the phenomena of the heavens. He thus saw
what no one previously had seen,<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> the satellites of
Jupiter, the spots on the Sun, and the moon-like
phases of the planet Venus, besides the greatly
increased number of stars, so many of which are
invisible to the naked eye.</p>

<p>The first-mentioned of these discoveries, that of
the satellites of Jupiter, seems to have created an
immense sensation among the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">savants</i> of that day.
It <em>suggested</em> that the theories of Ptolemy were anything
but complete or correct, and yet it <em>proved</em>
nothing, excepting against those <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">à priori</i> reasoners,
who would not believe that a body round which a
moon circulated could itself be in motion; but the
phases of Venus were simply conclusive against the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
Ptolemaic system, and for this reason: According to
that system Venus was a planet revolving round the
Earth in an orbit outside that of Mercury, but within
that of the Sun. Now the phases of Venus did not
correspond with any supposed period of her revolution
round the Earth, as the phases of the Moon
obviously do, nor did any one ever imagine that the
Earth went round Venus. They did, however, correspond
with the time of a probable orbit in which
either Venus revolved round the Sun or the Sun
round Venus; and here again this latter alternative
was inadmissible. There remained, therefore, the
one only reasonable solution of the phenomenon,
namely, that Venus travelled in an orbit round the
Sun. This was further confirmed when, in December,
1639, our own countryman, Horrox, at that time a
young curate residing in the north of England, but
gifted with a knowledge of astronomy which would
have done credit to a man of double his age and
experience, observed a transit of the planet across
the Sun’s disc. This occurred some few years after
Galileo’s condemnation; but it may be remarked that
Gassendi had already, in November, 1631, witnessed
a transit of Mercury. Thus it appeared that these
two planets revolved round the Sun, contrary to what
Ptolemy had supposed. And yet this was not conclusive
in favour of Copernicanism, for the theory
of Tycho Brahé was precisely to this effect: that
the planets revolved round the Sun, and that the Sun
in his turn circulated round the Earth. This hypothesis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
was of the nature of a compromise, and it has
been said that Tycho was led to it by his interpretation
of Scripture rather than of Nature; yet he was
one of the best astronomers and best observers of
his age, and had Kepler for one of his pupils. He
had a reason, too, for rejecting Copernicanism which
in his time seemed to have considerable weight,
namely, the incredible distances at which the fixed
stars must be supposed to be placed if the theory
were true, since no sensible motion could be detected
among them—apparent motion, that is—such as
would result from the annual motion of the Earth
if the stars were at any distance approaching to that
of the planets. We know now how futile this objection
is, but in that age there was an idea that Nature
could never allow of such a waste of space as is
implied in these vast distances. If Tycho had lived
longer, we may well doubt whether he would have
adhered to his system. Kepler saw its weakness, and
was the first to discover the true nature of the curves
which both the Earth and the planets describe in their
respective orbits; and this, although he did not know
the first law of motion. His books, published in
1619 and 1622, stated not only the elliptic form of
the orbits, which no one previously had found out,
but also the important law connecting the distances
of the planets with their periods of revolution.</p>

<p>It is necessary to bear in mind how gradually these
various items of knowledge dawned upon the scientific
world, and how imperfect was the state in which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
the study of astronomy remained until the discovery
of that great law of gravitation, which binds together
and regulates the physical universe. Men of mature
years had not then learnt the lesson now taught to
youths at college, that in natural science we must
discard <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">à priori</i> arguments, and trust to the experimental
method for guidance. It has been said contemptuously
that the Cardinals who condemned
Galileo and the Copernican system were not only
ignorant of the science of the present day (which
was inevitable), but even of that of their own day.
If that means merely that they were deficient in that
far-reaching intelligence which enables some gifted
men to foresee the future effect of recent discoveries
and hypotheses scarcely emerged from a state of
embryo, we may readily grant it.</p>

<p>We may allow also that some of the recent discoveries
of Galileo, as, for instance, that of the phases
of Venus, were not at first fully appreciated, nor their
bearing on the controversy perfectly understood,
excepting by professed astronomers. It required careful
observation to perceive that this planet’s phases
were only to be explained on the theory of her
revolving round the Sun.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if these ecclesiastics were wise
enough to see the futility of Galileo’s argument drawn
from the tides, it is certainly not for us to blame
them; the tides have nothing to do with the
questions then at issue.</p>

<p>And it is only fair to remember that supposing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
Ptolemy completely overthrown, as in reality he
assuredly was, by the observations on Venus and
Mercury, there remained the system of Tycho Brahé,
as has been remarked already, and this system partly
met the case of those phenomena that Ptolemy
failed in accounting for; and although we can easily
see now that it was something of the nature of a
makeshift, at that time there was no clear or conclusive
evidence against it.</p>

<p>I proceed now to state what appears to have been
the ecclesiastical force of the two condemnations by
the Roman tribunals—that of the Index prohibiting
certain books, and that of the Inquisition punishing
Galileo individually, and forcing him to abjure his
real or imputed opinions on the Copernican system
of astronomy. I trust I shall not lose sight of my
position as a <em>lay theologian</em> (in the sense I have
defined the term), or trespass upon strictly ecclesiastical
preserves; but I may surely say at once, that
it is evident no decision was pronounced on any
matter of faith. The first case, that of the Index in
1616, I have already discussed; and as for the latter
one, that of the Inquisition, it seems hardly credible
that any one should maintain that the sentence of a
Roman tribunal on an individual, however eminent,
could constitute an <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ex cathedrâ</i> decision on a question
of faith. Mr. Roberts, however, seems to maintain
something very like this; but he does so by taking
some strong, and perhaps extreme, statements made
by theologians, such as M. Bouix and Dr. Ward,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
when writing on some totally different point, and by
urging that if these things are true, then Galileo’s
condemnation was tantamount to a definition <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">de fide</i>.</p>

<p>I do not feel called upon to answer arguments of
this kind. But there is another which is more
relevant, drawn from the Brief addressed by Pope
Pius IX. to the Archbishop of Munich, about twenty-five
years ago, when the congress of philosophers, of
whom Dr. Döllinger was the leading spirit, had been
held in that city. In that Brief, the Pope states that
it is requisite for good Christians to subject themselves
in conscience to decisions pertaining to doctrine that
are put forth by the Pontifical Congregations; and
also to such heads of doctrine as are held to be
theological truths by the common consent of Catholics,
even when the denial of these does not involve heresy,
but deserves some other censure.</p>

<p>Theologians, I believe, are not agreed as to whether
this Brief is strictly <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ex cathedrâ</i>, and therefore to be
treated as infallible. But let us assume that it
is so. Does the expression, “subject themselves in
conscience,” mean necessarily anything more than a
respectful acquiescence, as distinguished from a full
interior assent? And, allowing that it does even
mean this latter, it is for <em>doctrinal</em> decisions that such
authority is claimed; and what I am maintaining is,
that the decrees in the case of Galileo were purely
disciplinary.</p>

<p>I do not of course deny that the line of demarcation
between doctrinal and disciplinary is sometimes hard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
to define. But surely the putting of books on the
“<cite xml:lang="la" lang="la">Index Librorum Prohibitorum</cite>,” whatever be the
reasons stated for doing so, is essentially an act of
discipline; and so also is the condemnation of any
individual man for having disobeyed injunctions laid
upon him by authority, or for having disregarded the
principles laid down by the same authority for the
regulation of its practical conduct, so long as they
were in force, and not repealed by any subsequent
act.</p>

<p>And this leads me to touch upon another argument
of Mr. Roberts, who says, truly enough, that the
authority of Rome is greater than that of individual
theologians, and that Rome must know her own
mind. And because the decision of the Inquisition
in 1633, condemning Galileo personally, referred in
strong and marked language to the decree of the
Index in 1616, therefore he infers that the latter is
thereby proved to have been, in the judgment of
Rome herself, a doctrinal decision in the strict sense of
the words. It is quite true that the Inquisition said
that Galileo had done wrong in treating Copernicanism
as a probable opinion, since by no means could an
opinion be probable that had been declared and
defined to be contrary to Holy Scripture; they
also said in allusion to the decree of the Index that
the books treating of the doctrine had been prohibited,
and the doctrine—<i>i.e.</i> Copernicanism—had
been declared false and altogether contrary to sacred
and Divine Scripture. But a stream cannot rise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
higher than its source; and the Inquisition itself,
having no other powers but those entrusted to it
by the Pope, had no authority to put any more
stringent interpretation on the decree of 1616 than
what it already bore. So far as its actual wording
goes, it is palpably a disciplinary decree, though
founded on a doctrinal reason; and when the
Inquisition cited it as if it were more than this, their
language must be interpreted in accordance with the
facts of the case; that is, as meaning that for the
<em>purposes of discipline</em>, and for all practical intents
and purposes, it had been defined that such a theory
as that of Copernicus was inadmissible, and on the
ground that it was contrary to Scripture as hitherto
understood. But a decision of that nature is not
irrevocable; it holds good as long as the ecclesiastical
authorities determine it should do so, and no longer.</p>

<p>Rome must know her own mind, Mr. Roberts
says; and she has shown her own mind, and borne
out the construction I am putting on her acts, by
further and subsequent action; for, after suspending
the prohibitions against Copernicanism—or modifying
them—in 1757, a distinct permission was given in
1820 to teach the theory of the Earth’s movement;
and again, in 1822, the permission was repeated in a
more formal manner, and with the express sanction of
the Pope, Leo XII.</p>

<p>Now we know that doctrinal decrees, once fully
sanctioned and promulgated by the Holy See, are
irreversible; but disciplinary enactments are changed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
according to the needs of the time and the circumstances
of the Christian world.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> If, then, these decrees
against the Copernican theory of astronomy have
been practically repealed by a decision no less formal
than that which called them originally into existence,
it is certain that Rome, who knows her own mind as
well after the lapse of two hundred years as after that
of seventeen years, considered them as appertaining
to the province of discipline and not to that of
dogma.</p>

<p>Moreover, Pius IX., when addressing the Archbishop
of Munich, must have been well aware of the
above-named facts, and when he enunciated the
simple rule that good Catholics ought to submit in
conscience to the doctrinal decrees of the Roman
Congregations—indeed, how can any one imagine the
<em>rule</em> to be anything else?—he must in common
sense be understood to be speaking of decrees wholly
different in scope and character from those relating
to the case of Galileo and the system of Copernicus.</p>

<p>It must, nevertheless, be observed that an argument
has been adduced by Mr. Roberts, and repeated
even by so eminent a writer as Mr. Mivart, as if
it were something that threw a new and important
light on the subject. It is that Pope Alexander<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
VII., on the 5th March, 1664, published a Bull—known
as the Bull “<cite xml:lang="la" lang="la">Speculatores”</cite>—approving a
new and authentic edition of the Index of prohibited
books, which Index contained the decree of 1616,
and also the monitum of 1620, ordering certain
corrections in the work of Copernicus, so that the
theory he advocated should be stated merely as a
hypothesis—in the preamble of which monitum,
however, it is stated that the principles of Copernicus,
relating to the movement of the Earth, were contrary
to the true and Catholic interpretation of Holy
Scripture—and contained also an edict, signed by
Bellarmine, prohibiting and condemning Kepler’s
work, “<cite xml:lang="la" lang="la">Epitome Astronomiæ Copernicanæ</cite>;” an
edict of August, 1634, prohibiting Galileo’s Dialogue;
and in fine, a prohibition of all books teaching the
movement of the Earth and the immobility of the
Sun.</p>

<p>In the year following this Bull another Index was
also published, in which the following words occur,
under the head Libri, as being forbidden to the faithful:
“<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Libri omnes, et quicumque libelli, commentarii,
compositiones, consulta, epistolæ, glossæ, opuscula,
orationes, responsa, tractatus, tam typis editi, quam
manuscripti, continentes et tractantes infrascriptas
materias, seu de infrascriptis materiis... De mobilitate
terræ, et immobilitate Solis.</span>” This, of course,
is very sweeping, as it includes all pamphlets and
letters, and even writings in manuscript, advocating
Copernicanism.</p>

<p>Now, in reply to all this, I think I may remark<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
that even lay theologians know, or ought to know,
that Papal Bulls are divided into two distinct classes—dogmatic
and disciplinary. The first, according to
the doctrine of the Catholic Church, are held to be
infallible, but still only as regards the decisions on
faith or morals therein laid down, and not in respect
of the reasons alleged; the second stand in a totally
different position, and are not considered, as a general
rule, to be in any way infallible—in fact, they are
liable at any time to be modified or recalled, as in the
instance before us has actually happened. The Bull
“<cite xml:lang="la" lang="la">Speculatores</cite>” is plainly a disciplinary one. But I
may perhaps be allowed to quote one who is professedly
a theologian—the Reverend Jeremiah Murphy,
an Irish ecclesiastic of learning and ability—who, replying
to Mr. Mivart in <cite>The Nineteenth Century</cite> of
May, 1886, explains, at some length, the real nature
of this Bull. He says: “This Bull, so far from being
a special approbation of each decree contained in the
Index to which it is prefixed, is not a special approbation
of even one of them.... It is a re-issue, by public
authority, of all these decrees (those of the Index),
but it leaves each decree just as it was.... The Pope,
after referring to the origin of the Index, says that at
that time there was no catalogue, issued by public
authority, embracing the prohibited books and condemned
authors, on which account great confusion has
arisen. Accordingly, with the advice of the Cardinals,
the Pope, as he states, has decreed to issue a new<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
Index. This was done in order that people should
‘have a clear knowledge of all that was done from the
beginning in this matter,’ also to facilitate references
for readers and especially for booksellers. The Pope
goes on to say that he ‘confirmed and approved this
same general Index as aforesaid, composed and revised
by our order, and printed at our apostolic press.’”</p>

<p>Mr. Murphy adds: “No new decree is issued, no
new obligation imposed, no change in the character of
any of the decrees is made by this Bull.... No
Catholic theologian would for a moment regard this
Bull as equivalent to an approbation, by special mandate,
of any decree contained in the volume to which
it is prefixed.... The Bull is a purely disciplinary
act, perfectly valid until it is cancelled by an authority
equal to that which issued it, but it condemns no
new error, and defines no new truth.”</p>

<p>It may no doubt be urged that there have been
certain indiscreet controversialists who have maintained
that the Popes had nothing to do with the
condemnation of Galileo or of the Copernican theory—that,
in fact, it was all the work of the Cardinals.</p>

<p>The Bull “<cite xml:lang="la" lang="la">Speculatores</cite>” is a good <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">argumentum
ad hominem</i> addressed to such persons, but no one
who knows the facts of the case can take up or ought
to take up such a position. As a matter of discipline,
the Popes did give their sanction to the condemnation
in question. The Congregations of the Index and of
the Inquisition have no authority at all except so far
as the Pope confers it on them; and whether he gives<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
them the authority beforehand, or confirms their acts
by subsequent approval, the principle is essentially
the same. He delegates to them certain disciplinary
powers, but he does not delegate, and has not the
power to delegate, his prerogative of defining dogma,
and enforcing its belief on the whole Catholic world.</p>

<p>I should not have dwelt at so much length on this
particular point had it not been urged, with what I
fear I must call much perverted ingenuity, by Mr.
Roberts that the Copernican theory was condemned
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ex cathedrâ</i>, as if it were a heresy, by the Pope himself;
nor, again, is it willingly that I quote so frequently
the same author’s arguments with a view to
their refutation. He has, however, stated the anti-Roman
case with ability, and without descending to
vulgar claptrap. If, then, his arguments are satisfactorily
answered, there is no need of combating
other antagonists.</p>

<p>But I do not at all shrink from considering another
and most important question. I have shown clearly
and conclusively that the decrees against Copernicanism
were not definitions of faith; but I am bound
to state now what I believe to have been the effect of
them in their own undoubted sphere, that of ecclesiastical
discipline. And here there are two distinct
questions to deal with, which are perhaps sometimes
mixed up together, but which ought to be kept
separate.</p>

<p>One is this: What should have been the conduct
of contemporary Catholics, supposed to be scientific<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
men, during the period that the decrees were in
force? The other: What opinion ought <em>we</em> now
to form upon the whole transaction, viewing it
retrospectively?</p>

<p>To begin with the first of these two. I have little
doubt as to what ought to have been the conduct of
such Catholics—viz., implicit obedience to the disciplinary
rules of the Church so long as the superior
authorities thought fit to enforce them. Thus no
good Catholic could have read the forbidden books,
whether by Galileo or by any other author, without
obtaining the requisite permission—a permission
which in these days, at any rate, is given with great
readiness to well-educated persons. Still less could
a conscientious Catholic publish a work advocating
the Copernican theory as the true one, or as most
probably the true one. What I think he might have
done is to publish a treatise stating any purely
astronomical or mathematical arguments which
seemed to favour Copernicanism as a hypothesis,
and, at the same time, professing his entire submission
to the ecclesiastical authorities, and explicitly
disclaiming any attempt to meddle with the interpretation
of Scripture. A protest of some such nature
as this was inserted in an edition of the “Principia”
which was allowed to be published by two Fathers
of the order of Minims, Le Seur and Jacquier,
in the year 1742, when the decrees were still in
force.</p>

<p>But the first step, and that the most fitting and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
becoming, would have been to submit privately to the
Roman authorities all the scientific arguments which
the Catholic astronomer—supposing such to be the
case—had discovered as throwing fresh light on the
question. No one has a right to infer from the
instance of Galileo, whose arguments were not all
of them sound or convincing, that such an astronomer
as I have imagined would have been treated with
contempt or neglect, especially if he made it evident
that he was wholly submissive to the decrees of the
Index, or other Roman Congregations.</p>

<p>Some writers, and notably the late Dr. Ward, have
maintained that besides outward submission, a certain
“interior assent” was due to the decision of the
Congregation of the Index—such assent, however,
being different in kind from that given to an article
of Faith.</p>

<p>I submit, however, that although the fact of a
book being placed on the forbidden list requires from
all good Catholics a respectful assent to the <em>principle</em>
that the Church has a right to enact these rules of
discipline, it does not require an interior act of
intellectual approval. It is said that Bellarmine’s
great controversial work was for a short time placed
on the Index on account of some unpalatable opinion
expressed in it. Did he think it necessary to make
an interior act of assent to the decree?</p>

<p>It is true that in the case of the works of
Copernicus and others, the grounds for prohibiting
them were stated; but I would ask, are we obliged to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
assent interiorly to the grounds alleged for such
acts?</p>

<p>In saying this, I do not wish to contradict the
opinion of those theologians who hold that the non-scientific
Catholics of Galileo’s age were bound, by
what is termed “the piety of Faith,” to give a
certain interior assent to the pronouncements of the
Roman Congregations; and that on the ground that
such persons had no better evidence to act upon.
Their assent then would be very much like that
given by dutiful sons, not yet of age, to the opinions
of their father; similar in kind though stronger in
degree.</p>

<p>I am of course assuming the contemporary Catholics,
whose case I am considering, to be men of an obedient
and dutiful disposition.</p>

<p>I have confined myself so far to the decrees of the
Index. The sentence of the Inquisition on Galileo
affected himself alone. It was no doubt held up
as an example <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">in terrorem</i> for the benefit of others;
but strictly and immediately it concerned Galileo
alone, and when he died, it died with him.</p>

<p>I now pass to the all-important question, what
ought we to think of the whole proceeding, with
all the light that has been thrown on it by the
two centuries and a half that have since elapsed?
Here, then, I have to steer a middle course between
what I hold to be extreme opinions on opposite
sides, each held by men of note, and men whose
principles and character demand that they should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
be heard with respect. One opinion is that of the
late Dr. Ward, whom I take as a representative
man on his side, though he is not the only writer
who has taken the view to which I allude, and it
is to the effect that the Roman Congregations acted
not only fully within their rights, not only within
their legitimate sphere, but that, considering all
the circumstances of their time, they acted wisely
and prudently; that the fault was on the side of
Galileo and his followers, and the Cardinals could
not have done otherwise than they did.</p>

<p>The other and opposite opinion has been stated
by no Catholic writer with greater force than by
Mr. Mivart; and it amounts, so far as I understand
it, to this: that the Church has no authority to
interfere in matters relating to physical science, and
that the issue of the Galileo case has proved the
fallacy of her attempting to do so; that without
entering into the discussion of what ought or what
ought not to have been done in former times, we
of the present generation have evidence sufficient
to show us that scientific investigations should by
right be free from the control of ecclesiastical
authority. The distinguished author to whom I
allude has somewhat modified his original statements,
and so I am in some danger of misrepresenting
him, but I think the above is a fair epitome
of his views on the subject; and at any rate I
feel myself justified in dealing with him as he
appeared in the widely circulated periodical in which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
he first enunciated his opinions, excepting so far
as he may have explicitly retracted what he then
said (which I do not believe to be the fact).</p>

<p>I regret that it is my lot to differ from both
these able writers. As against Mr. Mivart, I venture
to maintain that the Church has a full right to
control the study of physical science; as against
the late Dr. Ward, that we are not called upon
to defend the action of the Congregation of the
Index or of the Inquisition in this particular instance.</p>

<p>I take Mr. Mivart first, and I may be permitted
to say that had it not been for his somewhat
aggressive article, I should not have ventured to
publish my own views on the subject. I call it
aggressive because, though the writer would doubtless
disclaim such intention, it seemed as though
he were determined, so to speak, to drive the
ecclesiastical authorities into a corner, and leave
them no honourable mode of exit; letting his readers
infer that, because certain untenable decisions were
once promulgated, it results that no further respect
need now be paid to the same authorities when
touching on similar questions. Now, it need scarcely
be pointed out that no one would presume to treat
the decision of secular courts—assuredly fallible as
they are—in so contemptuous a way; and if any
one practically did so, the executive of the country
where it occurred, unless it had fallen into a condition
of hopeless impotence, would speedily vindicate
the rights of the courts so impugned. But if it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
should be urged that the two cases are not parallel,
I prefer to confine my argument to ecclesiastical
tribunals only. I maintain, then, that—always
assuming the truth of the Catholic standpoint, which,
with Mr. Mivart, I am justified in doing—the Church
has an obvious right to interfere with and to regulate
the study of physical science and the promulgation
of scientific theories. It would be more consistent
and more intelligible to deny the right of the Church
to proscribe any theories whatever, or to forbid the
reading of any books, however profane, than to admit
it in all other matters, but deny it in the one case
of physical science.</p>

<p>I yield to no one in feeling a deep interest in
science generally, and especially astronomy, the
Queen of Sciences, as it is sometimes called; many
sciences, and astronomy in particular, well deserve
to be studied for their own sake, and for the intellectual
profit and pleasure they convey to the mind,
putting aside all questions of practical utility. And
yet if we are to measure all the advantages derivable
from the study of natural science against the mighty
and momentous issues which Religion brings before
us, it seems to me that in so doing we are measuring
some finite quantity with that which transcends all
our powers of comparison because it is not only vast
but simply <em>infinite</em>. If you do not believe Religion,
or at least revealed Religion, to be true, then I understand
your worshipping science, or like the Positivists
worshipping Humanity, or any idol you choose to constitute;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
but I do not understand a Christian’s doing so,
that is, a Christian in the strict and legitimate sense
of the word. Pursue science by all means, as you
pursue literature, art, or any other innocent human
study, but do not make it such an idol as to obscure
your perception of spiritual truths.</p>

<p>And to take the Copernican theory in particular:
profoundly interesting as it is, let us ask ourselves
not merely whether it is so important as to require
that all religious considerations should give way
before it, but whether the knowledge of its truth,
which we now possess, adds very materially to the
sum total of human happiness. Let us then, for a
moment, think how many men among the millions
that people this Earth, or if we please to limit our
inquiry, how many among the civilised nations of
the Earth understand anything whatever about the
motions of the heavenly bodies. No doubt, in
England, and probably many other countries, the
elementary books that are taught to children state
in a rough general way that the Earth, like other
planets, goes round the Sun in the space of one year,
and revolves on its axis in twenty-four hours. So
far, so good. Suppose you asked those, who as
children have learned these facts, a few ordinary
questions in astronomy—I do not mean things relating
to celestial distances, or anything that can be
learnt by heart, but questions requiring thought—how
many would be able to answer you? How
many, for example, could explain such a familiar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
phenomenon as the harvest moon?—though that
has nothing to do with the Copernican theory. How
many could explain the precession of the equinoxes?
Suppose yourself in a room full of educated persons,
but not specially instructed in science, how many
could state correctly the first law of motion?<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a></p>

<p>It is unnecessary to multiply instances; astronomy
is obviously a science adapted not to the multitude
of mankind, but to the comparatively few, who reflect
and think. If, then, some check were given in the
seventeenth century, by the action of the ecclesiastical
authorities in Rome, to the progress of physical
astronomy, we must surely allow that the injury
to human welfare and human happiness was so small
that we need not dwell upon it.</p>

<p>Mr. Mivart tells us that Descartes was deterred for
some time from publishing his work. Now Descartes,
as a pure mathematician, stands in the highest rank.
The method which he invented of applying algebraical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
analysis to geometry has facilitated calculation to an
extent impossible to over-estimate; notwithstanding
the discovery and adoption of other and rival methods,
that of Descartes still holds its own, and will
probably do so as long as the science of mathematics
is cultivated.</p>

<p>But as an astronomer, Descartes can be allowed
no such pre-eminence; his work on Vortices was
actually a retrograde step, and in France it even
hindered for a considerable time the reception of
the true doctrine of universal gravitation. So that
we may well say if Descartes had never published
his book at all, physical astronomy would have
been the gainer rather than the loser.</p>

<p>Mr. Mivart writes as if he were under some apprehension
that the Church would interfere with his
favourite study of biology. I believe his fears are
unfounded. The Roman ecclesiastical authorities
are doubtless conscious of the fact that there is a
great moral chasm between the Europe of the seventeenth
century and the Europe of this day. The
means that were adapted for contending against
error, real or supposed, two hundred and fifty years
ago, are inapplicable in the present age. Experience
has shown that false scientific theories are pretty sure
to be demolished, time enough being allowed, either by
the internal dissensions of their own supporters, or by
the sharp criticism of the supporters of some antagonistic
theory; or, perhaps, the triumphant progress
of new discoveries. Works of a particularly offensive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
or irreligious character may from time to time be
put on the Index of prohibited books; but the
Church will probably leave purely scientific hypotheses
of all kinds to find their own level, and to stand or
fall, as the case may be.</p>

<p>There remains one objection, brought forward by
Mr. Roberts, which I may notice. It is one of the
condemned propositions recited in the well-known
“Syllabus,” that the decrees of the Apostolic See and
the Roman Congregations hinder the free progress of
science. But can any one honestly say that they do?
It is one thing to admit that the Church may for
certain reasons put an occasional and temporary check
on the study of some particular science; another, to
accuse her of generally and systematically hindering
the progress of knowledge; for be it observed that
the Latin word, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">scientia</i>, from which the above is
translated, does not merely mean physical science.</p>

<p>The Catholic Church has put strong restrictions on
the use of vernacular translations of Holy Scripture—restrictions
which, though greatly modified in practice,
are not yet abolished—but a proposition stating
broadly that the Church was opposed to the study of
Scripture would be condemned, and very justly so.</p>

<p>I now come to deal with the other extreme opinion,
if I may venture so to call it—that maintained by the
late Dr. Ward, and others—to the effect that not only
has the Church a right to condemn this or that
scientific theory, but that the exercise of such right,
as practically exemplified in the prohibition of certain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
Copernican works, and in the condemnation of
Galileo, was sound and prudent, and what might
reasonably have been expected. I am not sure
whether Dr. Ward goes quite so far as regards the
condemnation of Galileo by the Inquisition; but he
does so in respect of the previous decree of 1616.
His ground is that at that period the Copernican
doctrine was, even scientifically speaking, improbable;
while it gave a shock to those who venerated the
traditional interpretation of Holy Scripture. Few
men have a greater respect than myself for the
memory of the able writer whose views I am about to
criticise; but physical science was not his strong
point. His knowledge of metaphysical philosophy
was great; so, too, was his knowledge of dogmatic
theology; but he does not appear to have been well
versed in natural science, and with that modesty
which is a characteristic of sound and solid learning,
he was careful never to pretend acquaintance with
any particular branch of knowledge, unless he really
possessed it.</p>

<p>He was at times even scrupulous in expressing his
acknowledgments for the assistance he had received
from others in matters outside the limits of his own
studies; as also in admitting an error if he felt really
guilty of one; showing therein a candour and honesty
of purpose that we do not always meet with. So
much I say in tribute to an honoured memory. I
now proceed to state why I cannot follow his views.
It is surely paradoxical, to say the least of it, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
maintain that an opinion is theologically false but
scientifically true; or to state the case more accurately,
to maintain that it was right to condemn as contrary
to Scripture what has since turned out to be true—assuming,
of course, this latter to be the fact, which
Dr. Ward fully admitted. It may doubtless be
pleaded in mitigation that the Cardinals only meant
that the opinion was contrary to the <em>traditional</em>
interpretation of Scripture, and that it was just
conceivable that the method of interpretation would
have to be revised hereafter; and we have seen that
Bellarmine’s letter to Foscarini points decidedly in
that direction. Nevertheless, the decree on the face
of it appears to imply more than this, and when
coupled with the subsequent condemnation of Galileo,
and strengthened by the repeated prohibition, even in
more stringent terms, of all works favouring the
Copernican theory, it obviously dealt as heavy a blow
at the doctrine of the Earth’s diurnal and annual
movement, as could well have been done, short of a
dogmatic decision. It may be quite true that if
Galileo had been more prudent and judicious, much
of this would have been averted, and possibly the
decree of 1616 might have been modified or suspended
a century earlier than it actually was so. But without
discussing imaginary possibilities, we take the facts as
they stand.</p>

<p>Now to give one or two specimens of Dr. Ward’s
mode of writing on this subject. He says (after
stating correctly the Catholic principle that books<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
theologically unsound should be kept from persons
who are not specially qualified to read them without
injury): “In Galileo’s time all books which advocated
the truth of Copernicanism were theologically
unsound. And a most important service was done
by preserving the Catholic flock free from the plague;
free from a most false, proud, irreverent, and
dangerous principle of Scriptural interpretation.”—<cite>Dublin
Review</cite>, October, 1865.</p>

<p>I have already said that Galileo would have been
wiser if he had entirely left alone the question of the
interpretation of Scripture; but it must always be
remembered that it was not he but his opponents
who commenced the discussion on that particular
head. They were weak in the astronomical argument;
and they tried to damage their opponent by
attacking him on Scriptural grounds. It is difficult
to understand what Dr. Ward means by the forcible
language I have just quoted, nor how a principle of
Scriptural interpretation, adopted at the present day
by every one, could have been in Galileo’s time false,
proud, irreverent, and dangerous.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> Dr. Ward grounds<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
his argument, however, on an idea that he had, to the
effect that the Copernican system in Galileo’s day
was “scientifically unlikely:” this, however, is just
the reverse of the truth. It was <em>unproved</em>; and, as
I have repeatedly said, it is not even now proved to
absolute demonstration.</p>

<p>It is also true that certain most powerful arguments
for it were not then available, as I shall
hereafter have occasion to show at more length;
but it was not scientifically unlikely. Galileo had
indirectly damaged the cause by using a certain
erroneous argument in its favour; but then his
discoveries had simply pulverised the great rival
system of Ptolemy, and no astronomer, who knew
what he was about, could do otherwise than choose
between Copernicus and Tycho Brahé, each of these
being of course somewhat modified in detail. Now
the theory of Tycho Brahé was a new one, still newer
than that of Copernicus, and had all the appearance
of a temporary makeshift; it was not probable that
it would receive much approbation in the long run,
as in fact it never did. Probability (I mean, of
course, in a purely scientific sense) pointed strongly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
to the Copernican theory even in Galileo’s time;
and after Kepler’s celebrated laws had been published,
far more strongly still than before. Of course, as
Dr. Ward points out, there <em>may</em> be other reasons of
so cogent a nature as to outweigh <em>scientific</em> probability;
but that is not now the question: he denies
even the existence of this latter at the period we are
treating of; and on this point he was evidently
misinformed.</p>

<p>It is said that the Cardinals of the Index or
Inquisition consulted some astronomers before formulating
their decrees, and this is likely enough; as
there is <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">odium medicum</i> in these days, there was
doubtless <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">odium astronomicum</i> in those days.</p>

<p>And we may easily imagine how the philosophers
who believed in the infallibility of Aristotle looked
with horror and perhaps contempt on the School of
Galileo. If people once persuade themselves that
physical science is to be learnt merely from tradition,
or from <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">à priori</i> arguments, they will naturally have
an antipathy to the discoveries made by actual
observation and experiment. If men such as these
were called in to advise the Cardinals, we may well
admit it as a mitigating circumstance, forbidding us
to pass a severe judgment on the conduct of the
ecclesiastical tribunals. It is no part of my contention,
and indeed the very reverse, to lay excessive
blame on the Congregations of the Index and Inquisition;
but neither, on the other hand, do I understand
why we should give them our unqualified approval.</p>

<p>I feel that the opinion I have expressed above, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
which might otherwise be considered by some persons
as presumptuous towards the ecclesiastical authorities,
receives great confirmation, and at the same time
what is tantamount to an acquittal from all disrespect
to the Church and her authority, by the
following extract which I give from the article
entitled, “<cite>Dr. Mivart on Faith and Science</cite>,” published
in the October number of <cite>The Dublin Review</cite> (1887),
by the Bishop of Newport and Menevia, the Right
Rev. J. C. Hedley. Not only does the high character
of the author, both as a theologian and a
man of scientific knowledge, give a sanction to all
that is contained in the article, but the Review in
which it appears, having for its proprietor another
Bishop and an able ecclesiastic for its acting editor,
carries with it a stamp of Catholic authority such
as few periodicals possess. After some other remarks
the Bishop of Newport proceeds thus:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I do not by any means wish to deny that the case of Galileo has
had an important effect on the action of Church authorities. It
seems quite clear that it has made them more cautious in pronouncing
on the interpretation of Scripture when the sacred text
speaks of natural phenomena. The reason of this is not so
much the fact that science has proved authority wrong in one
case, as because that case, taking it with all its circumstances, was
one the like of which can never happen again. The Galilean
controversy marked the close of a period and the opening of a
new one. The heliocentric view was the first step in modern
scientific expression. Before the days of Galileo men spoke of
what they saw with the naked eye, and on the surface of things;
thenceforth they were to use the telescope and the microscope;
they investigated the bowels of the earth and the distances of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
heavens. It was a far-reaching and most pregnant generalisation
when men first took in the idea that the arrangements which
their books had hitherto called by the expression “nature” were
merely a very few of the most obvious aspects of a vast organisation,
which could be, and which must be, searched into by observation.
At once a multitude of familiar phrases lost their meaning,
and many accepted truths had to be dethroned.</p>

<p>And the effect of the discussion in the days of Galileo was not
only to make men revise their formularies about the earth’s
motion, but to impress them most forcibly with the possibility
that such a process might have to be gone through about a very
large number of other things. The prevailing views were held by
the Church authorities as by every one else. They were not
really a part of the Divine revelation. Some people thought they
were, and (we may admit it was a misfortune) the very authorities
who had to pronounce, used language which was to some extent
mistaken in the same direction. On the other hand, it is clear
now that men of mark and standing asserted over and over again,
that the new theories need not in any point contradict Holy
Scripture. It was a matter which was not clear all at once. It is
often not immediately evident that novel scientific views do or do
not contradict Revelation. They have to be made precise, to be
qualified, to be analysed, and that by fallible men. During the
process many Catholics will naturally make mistakes, and there is
no reason why, now and then, Church authority itself should not
make a mistake in this particular matter. When the requisite
reflection has had time to be made, then it is seen, as it was in the
case of the views under discussion, that what was held by Catholic
persons was something quite apart from Catholic faith. And we
have no objection to admit that reflection was quickened, and
caution was deepened by the case of Galileo. In this sense, and
not in any other, that case may be called “emancipatory.” If the
Church authorities ever feel themselves called upon to pronounce
on the dates or the authorship of the Hexateuch, or on the formation
of Adam’s body, they will proceed—we may say it without
suspicion of undutifulness—with more enlightened minds than the
Congregations which condemned Galileo.</p>

<p>The teaching Church is composed of fallible men, who must
sometimes, in certain departments, make mistakes, and who
must learn by experience as other men learn. The part of a dutiful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
Catholic is to lessen the effect of mistaken decisions by prudent
silence or respectful remonstrance in the proper quarter, and not to
make scandal worse by inept generalisations and unnecessary
bitterness.</p></blockquote>

<p>Further on, the Bishop says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I do not decline to face the difficulty of Galileo’s compulsory
retractation. It seems to me that either Galileo had sufficiently
strong reasons to prevent his mind from making the retractation or
not. I think it possible he had not. It does not seem that he
had anything like evidence that the earth moved. If he had not,
there was no reason why he should not assent to a strong expression
of authority, that authority being one to which he owed filial
obedience.... Still, if Galileo had present to his mind strong
proof of the correctness of his own teachings, I do not hesitate to
say that he was wrong, and, indeed, committed sin, in making the
retractation demanded.</p></blockquote>

<p>On the purely astronomical question whether
Galileo had evidence that the Earth moved, I
presume that the Bishop means <em>conclusive</em> evidence;
for evidence of some kind he surely had; not
conclusive, it is true, but good as far as it went.
Long before Galileo was tried by the tribunal of the
Inquisition, his contemporary, Kepler, had published
those important astronomical laws which still bear
his name, and which tended powerfully to corroborate
the theory of the Earth’s motion. Apart, however,
from this, as I have already intimated, I think
there was good ground for the opinion in question.</p>

<p>This, however, is to some extent a digression. I
have quoted the Bishop principally in order to
strengthen, by his high authority, the line of argument
I have ventured to pursue, which, in effect, is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
this: that the principle on which the Roman Congregations
acted in Galileo’s case was sound, but the
application of it in the particular instance mistaken
and injudicious.</p>

<p>I may also be permitted to cite, as confirming my
own opinion, the words of the distinguished writer
to whom, in common with all students of the Galileo
case, I am so much indebted, M. Henri de l’Épinois.
They do not, of course, possess the same theological
authority as that of the prelate I have just quoted,
but, coming from a learned Catholic layman, they are
well worthy of attention. These are his words:</p>

<blockquote xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">

<p>Galilée, en établissant les principes de mécanique qui sont ses
titres de gloire, comme en soutenant la doctrine de Copernic, a
rencontré pour adversaires déclarés les partisans de la philosophie
d’Aristote, qui combattaient aussi bien Képler à Tubingue, et
Descartes en Hollande. Ils appelèrent à leur aide des textes de
l’Écriture, les opposèrent aux affirmations de Galilée. Pour se
défendre celui-ci voulut expliquer ces textes. Dès lors, il changeait
l’interprétation jusque-là admise par l’Église et éveillait les justes
susceptibilités des Catholiques. Avait-il raison? Avait-il tort?
Il avait tort dans plusieurs de ses propositions, et sa conduite
manqua souvent de prudence; il avait évidemment raison dans sa
doctrine fondamentale. En fait le tribunal s’est trompé en condamnant
comme fausse et contraire à l’Écriture une doctrine vraie
et qui pouvait s’accorder avec les textes sacrés. Il a manqué de
prudence en se montrant trop circonspect, et a ainsi dépassé le but.
Il faut toutefois le remarquer. Aujourd’hui il est facile de
dire: le tribunal a eu tort; mais en 1616, en 1633, la plupart
des savants, les Universités et les Académies disaient: il a
raison....</p>

<p>Tous les témoignages contemporains nous montrent que deux
pensées, deux opinions, deux influences étaient en présence: d’un
côté les Aristotéliciens acharnés contre Galilée, détestant ses principes,
voulant les anéantir; de l’autre les papes, les cardinaux,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
pleins d’estime pour Galilée, mais qui voulaient prévenir les
fâcheuses conséquences de sa doctrine.</p>

<p>Selon que l’une ou l’autre de ces influences domina dans les
conseils, on tint une conduite différente: tantôt sévère et rigoureuse,
tantôt douce et indulgente. Mais il n’y eut point là, comme on
le prétend encore, de lutte entre la science et le Catholicisme: la
question fut débattue entre la science et l’Aristotélisme.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a></p></blockquote>

<p>It was not till the year 1757 that any authoritative
step was taken to relax the prohibitions imposed
by the Index on the works advocating the Copernican
system. This was more than a century after the
condemnation of Galileo, seventy years after the
publication of the “Principia,” and thirty years
after the discovery of the aberration of light. Even
Dr. Ward allows that it might have been more
prudent to remove the prohibitions some forty or
fifty years sooner than was actually the case. No
one, he observes, supposes the Church to be infallible
in mere matters of <em>prudence</em>, and I think that in
making this statement, which, I presume, every
theologian would at once endorse, he half admits
the principle for which I contend; for if the Roman
authorities could err in point of prudence in leaving
the censure so long in force, might they not err—I
mean, of course, as to the prudent administration
of discipline—in inflicting those censures at all, or
at any rate in applying them so rigorously in practice
as was done in the instance of Galileo?</p>

<p>However, be this as it may, in the year 1757 the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
relaxation of the censures took place; in 1820, on
the 16th August, a distinct permission was given
for teaching the movement of the Earth; and again
on the 17th September, 1822, a re-examination of
the whole subject having taken place, a decree
appeared, sanctioned by the Pope, Leo XII., in
which the Inquisitors General, in conformity with
the decrees of 1757 and 1820, declared that the
printing and publishing at Rome of works treating
of the movement of the Earth and the immobility
of the Sun, according to the opinion of modern astronomers,
was henceforth permitted. Thus the
decree of 1616 was practically abrogated.</p>

<p>Mr. Mivart, among other remarks on the proceedings
in Galileo’s case, says that no amends were
ever made by the authorities of the Church for
the injustice done to the philosopher, but he does
not state what kind of amends or what sort of
apology he expected. If he means that no personal
reparation was made to Galileo, that is doubtless
true; nor was any sacrifice ever offered to his
Manes. Indeed, it must be allowed that the ecclesiastical
authorities hindered the erection, after his
decease, of a monument in his honour. Nor is this
a matter for surprise; it may be taken for granted
that the object of those who desired to erect the
monument was to pay an especial tribute of respect
to the deceased astronomer as one who had suffered
unjustly; and that was precisely what the Pope<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
and Cardinals of that age would not for a moment
admit.</p>

<p>No personal amends, then, were made to Galileo
in life or in death; but I think this was not the
point to which Mr. Mivart intended to allude. I
believe he had in his mind a different sort of reparation—that,
namely, supposed to be owing to
the injured cause of Science. If that be so, then
I can only say that he must have been unaware
of the facts above mentioned, of the proceedings
taken in Rome in 1757, in 1820, and in
1822.</p>

<p>The adjustment of the relations of revealed Religion
with physical Science is often perplexing, owing
partly to mistaken zeal in insisting on particular
interpretations of certain passages in Holy Scripture,
and partly to the prevalence, at different times, of
doubtful scientific theories, which flourish for a time,
and then fade away because they fail to stand the
test of continued and rigorous investigation.</p>

<p>Instances of both these will readily occur to the
mind, and the Copernican theory in the seventeenth
century will be a prominent one, as coming under the
first of the two heads. But it is not fair, as I have
already argued, to be too severe upon the men who
clung with tenacity to the old traditional interpretation
of Scripture. It is, in fact, only right so to
cling until some just reason is shown for introducing
a fresh interpretation. In this case there were some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
good reasons, no doubt; but there were also bad
reasons alleged, and, as we have seen, Galileo, with
all his great ability and mechanical knowledge so far
beyond his age, could yet damage his cause with
unsound arguments.</p>

<p>Such being the case, amidst the whirlpool of good
and bad arguments—that drawn from the tides being
by no means the only one of the latter class—it is
not astonishing that even able and intelligent men
were misled.</p>

<p>The antipathy to adopting a new system of the
universe—a system which demolished many cherished
ideas and traditional opinions—was overwhelmingly
strong; the reasons uncertain, or, at least, inconclusive.
The discoveries of Galileo had, no doubt,
overthrown the system of Ptolemy, but they had not
established that of Copernicus, so long as there remained
what may be called the tentative theory of
Tycho Brahé, who was one of the greatest observers of
his day. Though he did not unravel the true cause
of the motions of the heavenly bodies, and went, in
fact, in a wrong direction, we must never forget the
important services he rendered to science. He was
the first to employ refraction as a correction to the
apparent positions of the celestial bodies; his collection
of instruments, on which he had expended the
whole of his private fortune, was the finest that had
ever yet been seen; and, in fact, his observations,
utilised by others, had a great share in leading to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
discovery of the real nature of the planetary movements.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a>
Small blame, then, must be meted out to
those who held on for a time to the system excogitated
by so enlightened a man. I do not mean
to deny what I have already stated—that the
Cardinals who put on the Index of forbidden books
the works of Copernicus and others, and those who
condemned Galileo, were unable, astronomically
speaking, to read the signs of the times. All
I am asserting is that there was much, even
from a scientific point of view, to excuse their
inability.</p>

<p>They put forward as their main objection that
the new theory contradicted Holy Scripture, and
adhered to that rigidly literal interpretation of it,
which has since then been necessarily given up, and
which seems somewhat strange to us, accustomed as
we now are to a far greater latitude of interpretation
than they even dreamed of. We who have learned
that the six days of Creation are not to be taken in
their strict sense;<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> who have sound reason for holding
that the Deluge was only universal in the sense of
covering that part of the earth then inhabited by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
human race; and who are told by some people, including
learned ecclesiastics, that it was more restricted
in its operation even than this; and who finally hear
it said by men of undoubted orthodoxy that the
evolution of man from some lower animal, so far as
his <em>body</em> is concerned and so long as you do not
include his soul and his rational faculties, is consistent
with the Christian faith—we, I say, who are
familiar with these non-literal interpretations of
Scripture, find it difficult to comprehend the standpoint
adopted and maintained with such tenacity by
the Cardinals of the seventeenth century.</p>

<p>There were, moreover, other very cogent reasons
which, though not put prominently forward, may well
have worked upon their minds; reasons, indeed,
which must strike the really thoughtful man. Let us
consider this one point. In old times, when the Earth
was believed to be the actual centre of the physical
universe, it was easy to suppose that it was the sole
abode of life. But if you believe that the Earth, far
from being such a centre, is only one amongst many
planets revolving round the Sun; and, further, that
the Sun himself is only one of a mighty host of stars,
some of which may have planets revolving round
them, you naturally ask yourself immediately, are
none of these worlds inhabited except our Earth?
Truly Scripture says nothing to contradict the opinion
that there are inhabitants and rational creatures to be
found elsewhere; but, nevertheless, the history of the
Creation and Redemption of the human race reads as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
if such creatures, intelligent beings like ourselves,
lived upon this Earth, and nowhere besides.</p>

<p>I know not how far thoughts and speculations of
this nature passed through the minds of the ecclesiastics,
and other men of religious feeling, in the age
of Galileo. They have since then been sifted more or
less by scientific men, and various opinions have been
suggested. Some went so far as to think it possible
that the Sun was inhabited. So able an astronomer
as Arago, to say nothing of others, thought such
might be the fact. No one thinks so now. The
tendency of modern thought, strictly speaking <em>modern</em>
(that is, the most recent), is rather to discredit such
imaginations. The various observations made upon
the Sun, including those made by the use of the
spectroscope, have shown that the supposition of his
being inhabited is simply incredible. For other
reasons the same result has been reached with regard
to the Moon. Then as to the planets, although there
are no such cogent reasons, we may fairly say that
the probability is against any one of them being at
the present moment fitted for the habitation of such
a creature as man. Some persons would make an
exception in favour of Mars, where a recent French
observer imagines he has detected signs of work as if
by human hands—a stretch indeed of imagination.</p>

<p>But the planets are probably not all in the same
stage of what may be termed geological history.
Some may very possibly be in the same state in
which the Earth was a few millions of years ago, long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
before it was fitted for the reception of man on its
surface, or, indeed, for that of any of the higher
mammalia. The Earth had had a long history, and
had undergone vast changes, ranging perhaps over
many millions of years, before man appeared on the
scene; and the period that has elapsed since that
event, whatever the date of it may be, is simply
nothing in comparison of the ages that had previously
rolled by since the first moment when the darkness
gave way, and the light appeared. It is, then, far
from unlikely that our own Earth is the only planet
in the solar system which at the present time is
suitable for the habitation of man, or creatures
resembling him.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a></p>

<p>Passing then from our own system, we come to the
myriads of suns, some, we may well believe, far greater
than our Sun, which are spread through the realms of
space.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> Many of these we may reasonably suppose
are surrounded by planets, and in one or two cases
there are special reasons for thinking that some
opaque body intervenes occasionally between the star
and ourselves. But the conditions under which
several of the stars (we know not how many) exist, is
very different from that to which we are accustomed
here with our own Sun. There are double stars which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
appear to revolve round a common centre of gravity,
a system of two suns. Have each of them, or have
both of them in common, a set of planets moving
round them? Who can tell? And where there are
stars with planets accompanying them, does any one
know in what state those planets are? The whole
subject, however interesting as a speculation, is
shrouded in impenetrable mystery.</p>

<p>From all this it follows that although there
certainly may be rational and intellectual inhabitants
on some or other of these distant worlds, yet, on the
other hand, there <em>may not</em> be. And it is perfectly
possible that our Earth, minute little object as it is,
comparatively speaking, may still be the great and
favoured life-house of the universe, the <em>moral</em>, though
not <em>material</em>, centre. That the Earth is not the
physical centre of the universe we now are well
aware; nor is the Sun the centre; nor, indeed, do we
know whether there is any such centre at all. There
is good reason for thinking that the Sun, with his
attendant planets, is in motion in a certain direction
in space; and I may observe that this direction is
not in the plane of the Earth’s orbit, or anything near
it; so that though the Earth describes an elliptical
orbit with regard to the Sun, its path in space is some
kind of spiral curve, that is as it would appear to a
being poised for a time in some point of space far
away outside our orbit, having the necessary powers
of vision, and having a plane of reference from which
he could take his observations.</p>

<p>What else this gifted being might see—whether he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
would observe some great central body round which
the whole of the heavenly bodies revolve, or, as seems
more probable, would detect, instead of one, many
centres, each with its own group—all this we do not
and cannot know, and we must be content, at least
so long as our life here below continues, to remain in
profound ignorance.</p>

<p>Seeing, then, how wide in extent and how difficult
of solution are some of the speculative problems,
originating in the Copernican theory, it can be no
matter of surprise that the ecclesiastics of the seventeenth
century recoiled from it with more than
common aversion.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">As</span> a sequel to the story of Galileo, I think it may be
interesting to inquire what the evidence, as <em>we now
have it</em>, proves with regard to the truth of the Copernican
theory, there being two opposite and contradictory
errors on this subject, and these not merely
popular errors, but shared to some extent by educated
and otherwise learned men. But I must, before proceeding,
remind my readers that I use the word
<em>Copernican</em> simply to signify the system of modern
astronomy, that in which the Sun is the centre round
which the Earth and the other planets revolve, and not
as meaning the precise theory of Copernicus, which
(as I have said) was overthrown by Kepler, when he
discovered that the planetary orbits were not circular
but elliptical, the Sun, moreover, not being strictly
in the centre, but in one of the foci of the orbit.</p>

<p>Now it is a plain fact, which all persons must perceive,
that either the Earth revolves on its axis in
twenty-four hours (more accurately 23 hours 56 mins.
5 secs.), or else that the whole of the celestial bodies
are carried round the Earth in that same time. It is
also a fact no less perceptible to <em>careful</em> observers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
that either the Sun goes round the Earth in the course
of a year, or else that the Earth goes round the Sun.
The question is how these facts are to be accounted for.</p>

<p>The first of the two errors I have just mentioned
is that which supposes the Copernican theory to
have been directly and conclusively proved. This I
imagine to be very common, and to arise from the
elementary books learnt by schoolboys, which state
(naturally enough) the modern theory of astronomy
without the reasons that support it.</p>

<p>We need not dwell long on this point. Persons
who have got this erroneous impression misunderstand
the nature of the evidence. Some things in
astronomy can be positively proved from observation,
as, for instance, the existence of sun-spots. Many
things in mechanics, chemistry, optics, and other
branches of physical study can be demonstrated by
experiment. The motion of the Earth round the Sun
cannot, however, be so treated. It is inferred, and
very rightly so, from the fact that it explains completely
and easily all the observed phenomena, while,
on the other hand, there are certain things which, as
<em>far as our present knowledge goes</em>, cannot be explained
in any other way; and the same argument
applies to the rotation of the Earth on its axis. But
though all this is perfectly clear so far, who can
possibly say that as science progresses some explanation
may not be hereafter found consistent with the
antagonistic theory—consistent, let us say, with the
system of Tycho Brahé, or some modification of it?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
I need not add that I consider the future discovery
of such explanation as so improbable, that one may
practically dismiss the idea, but I should be sorry to
deny it as being conceivably possible.</p>

<p>The other, and opposite, error is that of certain
well-meaning but ill-informed persons, who imagine
that the Copernican theory is even now doubtful and
liable to be overthrown—liable, I mean, in a real
and practical sense, and not by distant contingencies,
such as those at which I have just hinted, and which
may be considered as shadowy and intangible. I do
not suppose that amongst educated men there are
many such scientific recusants; but at any rate it
may be useful to give a short summary of the evidence
on which the Copernican conclusion is based.
In doing this I fear I shall tire the patience of my
readers by partly repeating Galileo’s own arguments,
which I have already quoted in discussing the Dialogue.
This cannot easily be avoided, for much of
his reasoning is so sound and so forcible, that after
the lapse of more than two centuries we can add
but little to it. On the other hand, there are grave
mistakes that must be shunned; and, moreover, there
have been discoveries made since the day when the
Dialogue was written, of inestimable importance.</p>

<p>The best way of treating the question is to resume
the history of astronomical research from the point
where we dropped it; that is, at the time when
Galileo first made known to the world the result of
his observations.</p>

<p>It ought to be clearly understood that from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
moment the telescope was turned on the heavens,
the old system of astronomy was doomed, and nothing
could finally have saved it. For a time prejudice
and other more creditable feelings kept it floating on
the sea of speculation, but such a state of things
could not last; and the startling information that
men like Galileo, Fabricius, and Scheiner imparted
to the scientific world, could not fail to expel the
old theory of the universe from the minds of men—at
least, men of intellectual capacity—gradually and
slowly, but yet most surely.</p>

<p>Now we have seen what the revelations were which
the telescope at once displayed, even in its comparatively
rude and imperfect state. There were the
spots on the Sun, the satellites of Jupiter, the phases
of Venus, the greater apparent size of the superior
planets (Mars and the rest) when on the opposite
side of the Earth from the Sun, this last phenomenon
being quite inconsistent with the system of Ptolemy.</p>

<p>One consequence of all this was that the less
enlightened men of the old school indulged in a
violent antipathy to the new-fangled instrument,
which threatened to overthrow their time-honoured
traditions, and simply refused to believe in the
telescope and its results. Thus the principal professor
of philosophy at Padua, when invited by
Galileo to look through his glass at the Moon and
the planets, pertinaciously refused to do so. Simplicio,
who, of course, represents in the Dialogue the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
prejudices of men of this stamp, admits (as we have
seen) his feelings on this subject, and his suspicions
that the new discoveries were to be attributed to
optical errors. He was willing to be corrected if
mistaken, but such had hitherto been his opinion.</p>

<p>It was not, however, to be expected that men of
sound sense would allow themselves to be misled
for any length of time by fallacies such as these.
Continued observations carefully made are sure to
correct mere optical errors, and after a reasonable
interval it must have been evident that the phenomena
discerned through the telescope were facts that
had to be dealt with—not phantoms to be ignored.</p>

<p>Thus, when it was found that the planet Venus
presented to the eye phases such as the Moon does,
instead of always appearing like a round body, it
became evident that she revolved, not as Ptolemy
supposed, round the Earth, but round the Sun, an
inference subsequently confirmed by the observation
of her transits over the Sun’s disc.</p>

<p>This being so, the adherents of Ptolemy had to
meet this difficulty: here was a planet much nearer
to the Earth than to the Sun,<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> and yet revolving
round the latter in preference to the former. There
was clearly, then, <em>some</em> attractive force belonging
to the Sun (whatever its nature might be), greater<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
than that of the Earth, which Venus obeyed; the
same was true of Mercury, with the difference that
this planet was much nearer to the Sun. Then
as regards the superior planets, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn,
the probability that the Sun was the great central
power that controlled their movements was a very
strong one. There is but little to add on these
topics to Galileo’s own forcible argument in the
third day’s dialogue; he is, however, inaccurate in
his figures, and states that Mars appears sixty times
as large when in opposition to the Sun, as at conjunction.
More recent observations have shown that
he appears rather more than thirty times as large
when at his nearest point to the Earth, than he
does when near his conjunction with the Sun, and
consequently at his farthest point from the Earth;
but this variation is quite sufficient for the argument,
and proves incontestably that if Mars revolves round
the Earth as in any way the centre of his orbit, it
must be in an ellipse of so great eccentricity as
no one could reasonably imagine him to do; indeed,
the anti-Copernicans of Galileo’s day knew nothing
of the elliptic motions of the planets; neither, as
we have seen, did Galileo himself.</p>

<p>The same argument, drawn from the apparent
size of the planet at different periods, applies also
to Jupiter and Saturn—the other exterior planets
were discovered much later—only not so strikingly
as in the case of Mars. The improbability, if we
once admit that all the planets revolve round the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
Sun, that the Earth, occupying the position it does,
should be at rest, while the Sun, controlling the
motions of the planets (vast bodies, some of them),
circled, nevertheless, round the Earth; the improbability,
I say, of this is so great as to be almost
overwhelming; at any rate, unless the difficulties
of the counter hypothesis were shown to be insurmountable,
which, as we know, is far from being the
case. It was of course possible, without going the
lengths of the Paduan professor, and setting oneself
against the telescope altogether, to admit the facts
but deny the inferences; to grant, for instance, that
Mars appeared to have a diameter more than six
times as great in one position as in another, and
to attribute it, as I hinted just now, to some extraordinary
eccentricity in his orbit round the Earth;
but it is not wise to look through a telescope with
the eyes of the body open and the eyes of the
mind closed; and generally it is but right to be
guided by clear and distinct probabilities when
discussing questions of natural philosophy on scientific
grounds—and it is of these alone that I am at
the present moment speaking.</p>

<p>It must be borne in mind distinctly that the
discovery of the moon-like phases of Venus, showing
her to revolve round the Sun, was simply conclusive
as against the old system of Ptolemy, which had
so long been the received system of astronomy. The
theory of Tycho Brahé, or some modification of it,
was the only one that could henceforth be adopted.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
But when you dethrone an ancient theory which
has for centuries held an almost undisputed sway,
you have to reconsider your whole position, and
compromises such as that of Tycho are not always
adequate to the emergency.</p>

<p>But these considerations formed only a part of
this complicated controversy. The anti-Copernicans
of the seventeenth century would not even admit
the revolution of the Earth on its own axis, and
were consequently forced to hold that the whole
of the heavenly bodies were carried round this our
globe in twenty-four hours. In ancient times, when
men knew little or nothing of the sizes and distances
of the Sun, the planets, or the stars, such a belief
was quite reasonable and natural; they thought the
stars were set as if they were jewels in a hollow
sphere, which was turned round its poles each day.
But the astronomers of Galileo’s day knew something
far more accurate than this; he himself, as we
observed in the Dialogue, greatly under-estimated
the distance and the size of the Sun, and had but
a very imperfect idea of the enormous interval that
separates us from the stars; yet he evidently perceived
the improbability of all these vast and remote bodies
revolving with an almost inconceivable velocity round
the Earth every twenty-four hours. And what must
be <em>our</em> judgment on such a subject, seeing that we
know the Sun’s mean distance to be about 92,000,000
miles, more than nineteen times as much as Galileo’s
estimate? And yet some of the planets are farther<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
and much farther from us than the Sun. Then as
regards the stars, α Centauri, the nearest of them,
is calculated to be more than 20,000,000,000,000
miles distant; but this calculation supposes the truth
of the Copernican theory, and that we may not seem
to argue in a circle, we will not use it, but content
ourselves with saying that, from certain reasons about
which there can be no mistake, we are sure that
the distance of the stars is very considerably greater
than even the remotest planet in our own system,
which is Neptune. Now, this planet’s distance from
the Sun is computed at 2,775,000,000 miles, and if,
indeed, he is carried daily round the Earth in a
circle, it must be with a velocity exceeding that
of light; the stars, therefore, with a velocity far
greater still. Now, nothing with which we are
acquainted moves with so great a speed as light—or,
as some men call it, <em>radiant energy</em>, meaning
thereby to include heat as well as light in the term—a
speed estimated at 186,000 miles in a second
of time. Are we then to believe that the stars are
carried in a circle round the Earth every day at a
velocity much exceeding even this? It seems almost
enough to ask such a question without pausing for
the answer. The simple rotation of the Earth on
its own axis explains all the phenomena without
resorting to such extreme suppositions as those just
mentioned.</p>

<p>It is remarkable that no one of any note—at least,
in modern times, for I am not so sure about the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
ancients—ever appears to have suggested the intermediate
theory of the Earth revolving on its axis,
and yet remaining stationary as regards any motion
of translation. With our present knowledge of
astronomy we could not entertain such an opinion,
though in the early part of the seventeenth century
it might have been considered plausible. Since,
however, it has not been maintained by any noteworthy
author, we need not further discuss it.</p>

<p>The reader will bear in mind what has already been
said on this branch of the subject in the second day’s
dialogue,<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> and it is not necessary to repeat it in
detail. It may, however, be useful to mention a
few experiments of a later date, which have tended<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
to confirm the truth of the Earth’s diurnal revolution.</p>

<p>Before the close of the seventeenth century it was
observed that a diminution of gravity occurred at,
and near, the equator. This was proved by the
vibration of the pendulum, an experiment associated
chiefly with the name of Richer; and it has, if I
mistake not, been since then carefully tested by
spring balances. This phenomenon is owing partly
to the spheroidal figure of the Earth—itself the
result of the rotation on the axis—but principally to
the centrifugal tendency being greater at the equator,
from the higher velocity of rotation.</p>

<p>I have already alluded to the trade winds, and the
argument to be drawn from them, which I think a
sound and strong one; but I need not dwell on it
further.</p>

<p>It is, however, well worth remembering that in
our own day another proof has been given, which
has been generally allowed to be an important one.
It is the result of an experiment of Foucault, and
is simply this: if a pendulum, with a heavy weight
attached to it, be made to oscillate in a plane due
north and south, say in the latitude of Paris, the
pendulum, after a time, and supposing it to continue
in movement long enough for the purpose of observation,
will oscillate in a direction slightly north-east
and south-west. Now the pendulum moves
naturally always in the same direction, backwards
and forwards, as originally started, and if the Earth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
were shaped like a cylinder no change would be
detected; but the spherical form of the Earth, as
it rotates on its axis, here makes the whole difference;
the floor of the room where the pendulum vibrates is
carried round the axis of rotation, as everything else
is, but the plane of oscillation remaining the same—or
parallel to the original one—it no longer points
north and south. At the equator this phenomenon
would disappear, and in the southern hemisphere it
would be the other way: that is, the pendulum would
vibrate north-west and south-east.</p>

<p>The same thing is exemplified by the small
machine called the gyroscope, where a heavy disc,
so adjusted as to revolve freely in any given
direction, independently of the frame in which it
is placed, will continue, when once set in rapid
motion, to spin in the same plane, directed, for
instance, to any one star that happens at the time
to be due north or due south of us, while the frame
moves round it with the rotation of the Earth.</p>

<p>I think, then, on the whole, we may say that those
persons who, in the present state of our knowledge
on the subject, are not convinced that the Earth
revolves on its own axis, would not be satisfied by
any evidence whatever.</p>

<p>Returning now to the general question of Copernicanism,
we find that for some time after the trial of
Galileo, things remained much <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">in statu quo</i>; unless
we except the observation of the transit of Venus, in
1639; but, as that eventful seventeenth century<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
was drawing to its close, there came on the scene
some thoughtful and able astronomers, who could
not only utilise the knowledge of their predecessors,
but could also guess, with more or less accuracy,
what that law—hitherto unknown—might be, which
governed the planets and our own Earth in their
movements. It was about this time that the Royal
Society was founded in London, and a stimulus was
thus given to investigation and to experiment. The
third law of Kepler, which states that in all the
planetary orbits the square of the periodic time of
revolution is in a constant proportion to the cube
of the mean distance, suggested the existence of
another law, not yet discovered, a law of attraction,
on which this itself depended. Among the astronomers
of that day three names deserve special
mention, Wren, Hooke, and Halley, because each of
them guessed with some accuracy at the true doctrine—as
it is now known to be—that the planets
are attracted to the Sun by a force which acts inversely
as the square of the distance. Hooke, in
particular, deserves the credit of having applied
this law to the path of a projectile, under certain
circumstances, as well as to the planetary orbits;
but though he thus lighted upon true conclusions,
he appears to have been deficient in mathematical
skill, and therefore unable to verify his results. It
is, however, only just to the memory of Horrox, who
was carried off by an early death, to mention that the
true theory of the identity of terrestrial and astronomical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
gravity had occurred to his mind; if he had
lived twenty or thirty years longer, he might have
survived in history as the discoverer of the great
problem.</p>

<p>Be this as it may, there now arose another man
greater than his predecessors, and greater than all
his contemporaries; he also was an Englishman,
by name Isaac Newton. What others guessed, or
concluded on insufficient evidence, became, in his
powerful hands, clear and well-grounded truths,
proved, so far as such things could be proved, by
rigid mathematical reasoning, and established on a
solid basis, which time has not shaken, and which
subsequent investigation has confirmed. Others had
supposed the existence of the law of attraction by
which the Sun acted on the planets; many persons
had understood the existence of terrestrial gravitation.
Newton showed that these two are identical;
and, moreover, that every particle of matter attracts
every other particle <em>mutually</em>, and according to the
one universal law, that of the inverse square of the
distance; so that a vast planet revolving round the
Sun obeys the same law as a pebble dropped from
one’s hand to the Earth. The popular story of his
having been suddenly led to this conclusion by the
sight of an apple falling is apparently fabulous;
and what really occurred is this: he sat alone one
day in a garden, and fell into a speculation (as men
of scientific mind are apt to do) on the power of
gravity, that is, of gravity as we feel it here on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
the Earth. Then it struck him that however high
you ascend, even on the loftiest mountains, no sensible
diminution in this remarkable force takes place; so,
he said to himself: why not as high as the Moon?
If so, perhaps she is retained in her orbit by this
very power. And again if so, what then? To
which question his active mind gave the just and
true answer, that it was probably one and the same
force that acted at the surface of the Earth, at the
distance of the Moon, and finally, as regulating the
action of the Sun on the planets.</p>

<p>It seems that there was an error, which it is unnecessary
to explain in detail, in Newton’s first
calculations; but that when, after a lapse of time
and with the error corrected, he again returned to
them, he found the motion of the Moon to be
exactly accounted for by his theory.</p>

<p>Again, in dealing with the complicated problem
of the action of the heavenly bodies one upon the
other, that is, when the disturbing force, for instance,
of a third body is brought to bear on the motions
of two others, although Hooke and others had as
a conjecture put forth the existence of such mutual
action, yet Newton was the first who thoroughly
grappled with it.</p>

<p>The mutual attraction of matter, so far as things
terrestrial are concerned, had occurred to the inquiring
intellect of Francis Bacon; but it was left
for Newton to propound it as the great principle
that governs the physical universe.</p>

<p>Now let us see how all this bears on the truth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
of the Copernican system. Newton proved—and I
may add that the improved methods of mathematics
which have been adopted since his day make the
proofs more simple and easy—that if any body moves
in an ellipse, or indeed, in one of the other conic
sections, the law of force, tending to the focus, is that
of the inverse square of the distance.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> Conversely,
he proved that a body under the action of a central
force, varying in intensity as the inverse square of
the distance, will move in a conic section.</p>

<p>Then if the Moon moved in an ellipse, as it was
easy to perceive that she did, and if her motion
corresponded precisely with what it would be on
the theory of universal gravitation; if also, as seemed
evident, the planets revolved in ellipses, then the
inference that the law of gravitation, as stated by
Newton, was true became irresistible; not susceptible,
as before stated, of direct and absolute
proof, but established conclusively by a sound and
legitimate induction.</p>

<p>What I have just stated shows that Kepler’s first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
law corresponds with Newton’s discovery; but the
same is true of the two other laws. It would of
course be out of place here to go minutely into
all the evidence which can be gathered in support of
the doctrine of universal gravitation. I may briefly
state that all of Kepler’s laws are simply explicable
by that hypothesis, and that the evidence derives
additional confirmation from the following curious
fact: observation shows that Kepler’s laws, though
approximately true, are not strictly and accurately
so; if the planets were mere particles revolving round
the Sun, they would then be quite rigidly true, but
the planets have a certain mass (though very small
compared to the Sun) and so do in some measure
attract the Sun as well as being attracted by him,
and they, moreover, exercise a disturbing influence
on each other. These perturbations, however,
have been calculated, and the result is that
they agree with what ought reasonably to be expected,
supposing the theory of universal gravitation
to be true. This confirmatory proof has been acquired,
I need not add, since the time of Newton
by the labours of astronomers, Laplace and others,
who have succeeded him, and who have had the
advantage of that more manageable method of
mathematical calculation to which I have just
alluded.</p>

<p>Supposing then the law of gravitation to be established
by sufficient proof, we may now ask what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
must become of the old systems of astronomy? What
must befall Ptolemy and even Tycho Brahé?</p>

<p>It is obvious that they could do nothing but collapse.
If the law of gravitation were once admitted
to be true, the idea of the Sun revolving round the
Earth must be dismissed as impossible. Here it is
right to remark that (assuming the law of universal
gravitation) it is not, strictly and scientifically speaking,
correct to say that any one heavenly body revolves
round another, but that they both revolve
round their common centre of gravity. In the case
of the Earth and the Sun, so vastly superior is the mass
of the latter that the centre of gravity is far away
within his volume, and the disturbance exercised on
him by the Earth is scarcely appreciable; so also, in
the case of the Moon and the Earth, the centre of
gravity is within the latter, but at a considerable
distance from its own centre; and here there is a
distinctly appreciable oscillation of the Earth, arising
from this very cause, during each revolution of the
Moon in her orbit. When two bodies are more nearly
equal in mass, as is probably the case with the double
stars that have been observed in recent times, then
the two revolve round a centre of gravity lying
between them, exterior to both of them. It is believed
that this is actually the fact in the instance I
am here alluding to of the double stars, and there is
some reason for supposing that the curve in which
they revolve is an ellipse. This, if true, would clearly
indicate that the law of gravitation, as stated by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
Newton, extends not only through our own solar
system, but over the whole material universe.</p>

<p>And there is one remarkable property of this mysterious
agency which we term gravitation, and that is
its instantaneous action even at the greatest distances.
Light travels with an enormous and yet a finite velocity,
so that it takes a few years to arrive at the Earth
from even the nearest stars. The force of gravity
knows no such limit, nor is its action retarded by even
the minutest fraction of time.</p>

<p>Nor, again, is it impeded, as in the case of light,
by any screen or obstacle of whatever nature. Furthermore,
it does not lose anything of its intensity, as
light does, by being diffused over a larger surface; it
varies as the <em>mass</em> of the bodies concerned, but not in
the least according to the extent of their surfaces.
Given the same distance, no diffusion weakens its
force.</p>

<p>Great as was the evidence adduced by Newton for
the truth of his theory, there were some real difficulties
in the way of its reception. I need not allude to
these in detail; they are explained in treatises on
physical astronomy for the benefit of those who are
interested in the subject. Briefly, I may say that
subsequent research and careful calculations have
removed the difficulties, and thereby confirmed the
already existing evidence.</p>

<p>Then, as regards terrestrial gravity, experiments
have been made—notably at the mountain Schehallion,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
in Scotland—throwing additional light upon it, and
indicating that not merely the Earth as a whole, but
any great mass, such as a mountain, exercises an
appreciable attractive force.</p>

<p>Newton seems to have expected that some further
discovery would take place, at no distant period, as to
the nature of this occult agency which operates so
powerfully in the heavens and on the Earth. In one
of his letters he strongly disclaims the opinion that
gravity is essential to matter and inherent in it; he
thinks it is “inconceivable that inanimate brute
matter should, without the mediation of something
else which is not material, operate on and affect other
matter without mutual contact... that gravity
should be innate, inherent, and essential to matter, so
that one body may act upon another at a distance
through a <em>vacuum</em>, without the mediation of anything
else by and through which their action and force may
be conveyed from one to another, is to me so great an
absurdity that I believe no man who has in philosophical
matters a competent faculty of thinking can
ever fall into it.”</p>

<p>And yet we see that what he thought absurd is still
apparently true, and that, great as was Newton’s
sagacity in discovering and proving the effects of this
great cosmical law, he failed when he came to speculate
on the more remote causes of it. Since his time,
other ingenious theorists have imagined hypotheses in
the hopes of accounting for it; but their efforts have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
not met with any great success, and the last word of
science on the subject is that the cause of gravitation
remains undiscovered.</p>

<p>But if the attempt to trace the ultimate cause of
the law of gravitation has been a failure, the proof of
its operation in the physical universe has been a marvellous
success, and that not only in the present day,
when difficulties have been removed and fresh evidence
has been added, but, to a certain extent, even in
Newton’s own time, and especially here in his own
country. Indeed, we cannot suppress a feeling of
admiration when we contemplate the revolution in
astronomy brought about by this quiet, unobtrusive
man, who is said to have spent thirty-five years of his
long life within the walls of Trinity College, Cambridge,
of which he was a Fellow, and who, though
twice elected to represent the University in Parliament,
never opened his lips in the House of Commons.
I may, perhaps, be here permitted to insert a passage
from a work to which I have previously alluded,
Whewell’s “History of the Inductive Sciences,”
well worth quoting both for its eloquence and its
truth. After recounting, with some detail, the circumstances
of this great epoch in astronomical knowledge,
he proceeds:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Such, then, is the great Newtonian induction of universal
gravitation, and such its history. It is indisputably and incomparably
the greatest scientific discovery ever made, whether we
look at the advance which it involved, the extent of the truth disclosed,
or the fundamental and satisfactory nature of this truth.
As to the first point, we may observe that any one of the five steps<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
into which we have separated the doctrine [these were, 1st, that
the force attracting <em>different</em> planets to the sun, and, 2nd, the force
attracting the <em>same</em> planet in different parts of its orbit, is as the
inverse square of the distances; 3rd, that the earth exerts such a
force on the moon, and that this is identical with terrestrial gravity;
4th, that there is a <em>mutual</em> attraction of the heavenly bodies on one
another; 5th, that there exists a mutual attraction of <em>all particles
of matter</em> throughout the universe] would of itself have been
considered as an important advance, would have conferred distinction
on the persons who made it, and the time to which it belonged.
All the five steps made at once formed not a leap, but a flight;
not an improvement merely, but a metamorphosis; not an epoch,
but a termination. Astronomy passed at once from its boyhood to
mature manhood. Again, with regard to the extent of the truth,
we obtain as wide a generalisation as our physical knowledge
admits when we learn that every particle of matter, in all times,
places, and circumstances, attracts every other particle in the
universe by one common law of action. And by saying that the
truth was of a fundamental and satisfactory nature, I mean that it
assigned, not a rule merely, but a cause, for the heavenly motions;
and that kind of cause which most eminently and peculiarly we
distinctly and thoroughly conceive, namely, mechanical force.
Kepler’s laws were merely <em>formal</em> rules, governing the celestial
motions according to the relations of space, time, and number;
Newton’s was a <em>causal</em> law, referring these motions to mechanical
reasons. It is no doubt conceivable that future discoveries may
both extend and further explain Newton’s doctrines; may make
gravitation a case of some wider law, and may disclose something
of the way in which it operates—questions with which Newton
himself struggled. But, in the meantime, few persons will dispute
that, both in generality and profundity, both in width and
depth, Newton’s theory is without a rival or neighbour.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The effect of all this on the Copernican system
and the evidence on which it rested, was to raise that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
system from a simple though strong probability, a
question on which at any rate something might be
said for and against it, to a probability of almost
overwhelming force; for it not only showed how the
heavenly bodies moved, but it explained the cause of
their motions, and in a word furnished the key that
unlocked the arcana of Nature. When you came to
know not only how the Moon and the planets moved,
but the law which regulated their movements, and
when you found that all fitted into one harmonious
whole (at least with some minor exceptions), it was
not easy to refuse assent to a theory supported by
such powerful evidence.</p>

<p>Yet in saying this we are perhaps rather viewing
the question from our present standpoint, than as a
contemporary would have done. As a matter of fact,
Newton’s hypothesis, though eagerly received in England,
met with a long opposition on the Continent,
and particularly in France, where Descartes’ theory
of vortices reigned supreme for many years. It must
not be supposed that these Cartesian philosophers were
anti-Copernicans; far otherwise, only they accounted
for the celestial motions in a different way from
Newton, and, as every one now admits, in a wrong
way.</p>

<p>I have already remarked that there were some
apparent difficulties in the application of the law of
universal gravitation to all the heavenly bodies, and
that these have been removed by subsequent calculation.
One of these difficulties, if indeed it could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
be so called (for it hardly amounted to that), has
been solved within living memory. It was noticed
that the planet Uranus showed signs of perturbation
from some unknown reason; and even the work I
have just quoted, “<cite>Whewell’s History of the Inductive
Sciences</cite>,” published in 1847, contains the following
sentence: “Uranus still deviates from his tabular
place, and the cause remains yet to be discovered.”
Two astronomers, one French and one English,
Le Verrier and Adams, found out the cause by
discovering the existence, each independently of the
other, of an exterior planet revolving in an orbit
more distant by far than that of Uranus; to this
planet the name of Neptune has been given, and his
existence is one more confirmatory proof of the theory
of gravitation.</p>

<p>The Copernican system had been built up and
consolidated by Newton’s great discovery; but
another piece of evidence, of a most important
character, was added by the investigations of Bradley,
Professor of Astronomy at Oxford, and afterwards
Astronomer Royal; this careful observer, while
engaged in endeavouring to detect such an apparent
motion of the fixed stars (so called) as would indicate
an annual parallax, noticed that another motion
existed different from that which the annual parallax
would produce, and for which he could not account;
the apparent orbits described by the stars observed
depended on the distance of the stars from the pole
of the ecliptic; the phenomenon was different from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
anything hitherto discovered, and one or two modes
of explanation were tried in vain. Accident, however,
turned Bradley’s thoughts in the right direction; he
was one day in a boat on the Thames, and observed
that the vane on the mast gave a different apparent
direction to the wind, according as the boat sailed in
different courses. Here, then, was the solution of the
difficulty: it was already known from Römer’s investigations
that light moved with a finite velocity,
and if so it would naturally produce the same effect
as that observed in the boat, or to take an illustration
very commonly given, like that which any one finds
when moving along rapidly in a shower of rain, in
which latter case the rain seems to fall not in the
direction it has when one is at rest, but in a direction
compounded of that and the one opposite to the
person’s line of motion.</p>

<p>Bradley soon drew the correct conclusion, that light
acted in precisely the same way upon the Earth as it
moved in its orbit, and that the <em>apparent</em> annual
displacement of the stars, as detected by him, arose
from this sole cause. All the great astronomers who
followed him have agreed with his conclusions, and
the phenomenon in question, which is called the
aberration of light, has conferred a lasting fame on
its discoverer. And the remarkable point about it is
this, that not only does it give a fresh illustration to
the Copernican theory, but it is one of the very few
scientific facts that cannot (so far as our knowledge
of the subject goes) be explained in any other way.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
It is, therefore, generally considered as a critical test
of the truth of the system.</p>

<p>There are two other phenomena, on which however
I do not propose to dwell at any length, known as
precession and nutation, which it is not easy to
explain otherwise than by the modern theory of
astronomy and the principle of gravitation; the latter
of these two owed its discovery to Bradley, and the
former to Hipparchus, who could not have been aware
of its real cause, though he had observed the fact of
its occurrence.</p>

<p>But passing on from these, I may call attention to
one most remarkable result of modern scientific
research, connected with the stars. In Galileo’s day,
it was a drawback to the Copernican theory that
none of the stars showed the smallest annual
parallax; in popular language, none of them seemed
to undergo any change of place, however small, when
observed at opposite points of the Earth’s orbit, or as
the opponents would have said, the Earth’s imagined
orbit. A displacement of this kind, I need hardly
repeat, must not be confounded with that other
motion which Bradley observed and explained. This
was one of Tycho Brahé’s reasons for rejecting the
Copernican system, and it was one of the best arguments
used by the opponents of Galileo. As the
enormous distance of the stars from the Earth was, as
we have already seen, at that time unknown, the
celestial distances generally being under-estimated
even by the best astronomers, the argument had an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
apparent force, which no one now would attribute
to it. Galileo himself had some hope of overcoming
the difficulty by discovering some annual displacement
in certain stars, but it is needless to add that
his instruments were unequal to such a task. Subsequent
observers tried various methods, but
without any real success until the present century,
when Bessel and other observers found that a star
called 61 Cygni had a certain annual parallax; and
not long afterwards, Henderson, making his observations
at the Cape of Good Hope on a conspicuous
star in the constellation of the Centaur, a constellation
belonging to the southern hemisphere, found
at length that this star, which in fact is a double
star, and known as α Centauri, had a parallax of
nearly 1″; subsequent calculations show it to be
probably rather less, that is to say about 0″·91. This
means that it is more than twenty billions of miles
distant, and that light takes more than three years to
travel from α Centauri to the earth. It is, however,
believed to be much the nearest of all the stars, no
other coming within double of the distance.</p>

<p>Now it is difficult to evade the conclusion which
naturally follows from these results, that the Earth
really does move in an annual orbit round the Sun.
It is no part of my present task to give a list of the
stars of which the parallax has been found, but I
may say there are several others besides the two I
have named; and I know of no method of accounting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
for the fact in any way but by the annual motion of
the Earth, unless we suppose some instrumental error
to have occurred. There have been so many of these
in times past that it may seem rash to exclude such a
possibility, but, considering the perfection of modern
scientific instruments, it is in the highest degree
improbable; and we may fairly reckon the parallaxes
of the stars as a strong confirmation of the already
strong evidence in favour of the Copernican theory—a
theory which, as we have seen, was, from a purely
scientific point of view, very probable in the days of
Galileo, overwhelmingly probable after the great
discovery of Newton, and at the present time, with
all the light that subsequent research and observation
have thrown on it, scarcely short of a moral
certainty.</p>

<p>I may repeat once more that it has not, indeed,
that absolute physical certainty, arising from direct
experiment, which has been obtained in other
scientific investigations; but, allowing for this faint
element of instability, we may fairly say that no
truth of natural philosophy stands on a firmer basis.</p>

<p>And for Galileo, who lived before the day when,
as Whewell says, “Astronomy passed from boyhood
to mature manhood,” we may fairly say that, after
we have censured his faults and his errors, after we
have ascertained that he was not a hero or a “martyr
of science,” we must still recognise the fact that he
was one of the greatest natural philosophers of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
day, pre-eminent in astronomy, in mechanics, in
mathematics. To his honour also be it added, that
his religious faith, and his respect for the Church and
her authority, so far as we can judge, never failed.
Whatever his defects may have been—want of prudence,
want of candour, want of consideration for
others—we can easily perceive that he would never
have been willingly drawn into any controversy
intended to provoke antagonism between Religion
and Science.</p>

<p>In the present age, unhappily, there have been
men who have taken the other course, and have
contributed their share towards exciting antagonism,
heedless of the consequences. Some have done this
unwittingly, arguing on the side of religion, but
without a proper supply of sound scientific information;
others, on the opposite side, have shown
so bitterly hostile a spirit to Revelation, if not
even to Natural Religion, as to render it more than
ever difficult to re-establish that concord between
the two studies, that of the supernatural and that
of the physical, which should never have been
interrupted.</p>

<p>This, however, is so wide a subject that I must
not be led into it. Yet I may briefly remark
that two of the greatest lights of the Catholic
Church, men whose teaching and whose writings have
exercised an undying influence, have both, either by
words explicitly, or implicitly by their example,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
contributed to encourage a sound knowledge of
natural philosophy, and in harmony with Christian
theology.</p>

<p>They both lived when physical science was in its
infancy, though at intervals of nearly 800 years
apart. St. Augustine, who flourished towards the
latter part of that period dominated by the corrupt
civilisation of ancient Rome, amongst his voluminous
works devoted one treatise to the interpretation of
the Book of Genesis, “<cite xml:lang="la" lang="la">De Genesi ad Litteram</cite>;”
and he takes the opportunity of cautioning those
whom he addresses against the risk of exciting the
ridicule of unbelievers by a mistaken adherence to
a rigidly literal interpretation of Holy Scripture.
He was, I believe, one of the first that interpreted
the six days of Creation in the non-literal sense,
though his particular theory is not one in accordance
with modern scientific opinion. I allude to him not
for the details of natural philosophy, but as enunciating
a principle, which some subsequent authors
have not followed as they might have done.</p>

<p>St. Thomas Aquinas lived in those middle ages of
which he was one of the most brilliant ornaments.
The power of his intellect is admitted by those who
have little sympathy with his teaching; his literary
industry is a standing marvel; and I have already
observed that besides the theological and metaphysical
works on which he expended so much labour, he
wrote a treatise on the astronomy of Aristotle. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
may be said this is no very great matter, but I
mention it as illustrating the breadth of mind of this
great saint and theologian, who could spare time for
a study of physical science without neglecting the
more solemn duties of his calling. His active mind
was alive to every source from whence wisdom and
learning could be imbibed; and if he had lived in
the age of Galileo, I have sometimes fancied that
he would have thrown some oil on the troubled
waters, would have counselled prudence to the adventurous
astronomer, patience and forbearance to his
antagonists. But it is of no avail to indulge in
speculations such as these. Each age of the world
has its difficulties, moral and intellectual, and we
can neither hurry the stream of human thought
onwards nor drive it backwards.</p>

<p>So again it is with the dispositions of individuals;
if Galileo had been gifted with the calm, dignified
reserve of Newton, instead of being the vivacious,
loquacious Italian that he in fact was, he might have
lived and died in peace.</p>

<p>And now, if I may be permitted to recur once more
to the subject of gravitation, I have a word to say as
to the lesson which this great all-pervading law seems
to teach. It has nothing to do with any question of
revealed Religion; but does it not bear the unmistakable
signs of the action of an all-wise, an
all-powerful Creator? It may possibly be the result
of some other, though unknown, law; and even then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
it brings us back to the same point. The result in
nature remains the same, and that result is written in
characters that cannot be ignored. Mathematicians
have occupied themselves in making suppositions as
to the effects of imaginary laws of gravity, some of
which might, no doubt, ensure sufficient order and
regularity to maintain this world, and the countless
worlds that people space, while others would cause
hopeless confusion. The striking thing is that the
existing law perfectly answers its purpose.</p>

<p>Only let us imagine that no law of attraction acted
upon matter at all, nor any force of whatever kind—what
would be the result? There would be no
coherence, no abode for human or animal life—nothing
but chaos and anarchy.</p>

<p>If, then, we contrast this imagined picture with the
one actually before us, we are, I think, forcibly led
to the conclusion that the physical universe owes its
origin, its existence, its harmony to an Omnipotent
Being, unseen, yet not unknown, intangible to the
senses, ever present to the intelligence.</p>

<p>And now, in order to avoid misapprehension, I
venture to restate briefly the propositions I have
sought to establish.</p>

<p>I have maintained that the Catholic Church has a
right to lay her restraining hand on the speculations
of Natural Science, just as much as she has in the
case of other speculative inquiries. Those who do
not believe in her prerogatives will, of course, deny<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
such right <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">in toto</i>; but I contend that if you grant
the existence of this right at all, you cannot exclude
Physical Science from its operation.</p>

<p>On the other hand, in the particular case of Galileo,
I have not attempted to defend all the proceedings
of the Cardinals of the Index and the Cardinals of the
Inquisition. For it must be remembered it was no
gentle rebuke with which the Copernican system
and the individual Galileo were visited; no such light
condemnation as that of placing on the Index of
prohibited books all Copernican works as being
<em>inopportune</em>, or again, that of a caution to Galileo
to be more prudent, was deemed adequate to the
emergency—if, indeed, any one even thought of
them.</p>

<p>So with the facts of the history before us, I think
any sweeping defence of the proceedings in question
would be unnecessary from an ecclesiastical point of
view, and from a scientific point of view untenable.</p>

<p>Moreover, I must add, as an indispensable premiss
to the conclusion just stated, I have also maintained
that the censures pronounced by the Cardinals on
both occasions were not dogmatic decisions, such as
Catholic theologians hold to be infallible; but disciplinary
enactments, varying with the changing
characters of different ages.</p>

<p>Then again, referring to the scientific questions
involved, we may see that Astronomy, considered
historically, is divided into three periods—the ancient<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
one before the invention of the telescope, that is,
up to the time of Galileo; the intermediate one,
when the telescope was in use but the law of
universal gravitation as yet unknown—from Galileo
until the publication of the “Principia” of Newton;
and the modern one, from Newton downwards.
During the first period it seemed highly probable to
the whole world, with the exception of a few gifted
intellects, that this Earth was the centre of the
Universe, and that all the heavenly bodies revolved
round it; during the second period, when the telescope
had shed a light so powerful and so brilliant
upon astronomical research that men could not
absolutely close their eyes to it even if they wished,
the balance of probability passed into the opposite
scale, and the more intelligent men of science guessed
at the truth, however indistinctly. But some elements
of uncertainty remained; and this circumstance, taken
in connection with the irrelevant arguments so much
in vogue at that time, must in all fairness be allowed
as an excuse for the many good men, ecclesiastics
and others, who opposed the Copernican doctrine.
After the great step made by Newton it was no
longer a question of balancing probabilities, for the
weights were almost all transferred to one scale,
and the probabilities of the truth of the Heliocentric
System (to give it for once its accurate name)
became overwhelming. The subsequent investigations
of Bradley and others have gone further still, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
have converted this strong, overpowering probability
into something approaching indefinitely near to a
moral certainty.</p>

<p>Beyond this we cannot reasonably expect to go;
<em>physical</em> certainty is not to be attained when we
have to traverse the vast distances of celestial
space, and human infirmity must be content to
recognise the boundary beyond which it may not
pass, the limit imposed on finite minds by the
Infinite.</p>

<p>
The planet was at the time a brilliant “morning star;” and the

in one of the articles of <cite>The Dublin Review</cite> (which he then edited)
of Copernicanism as destroying the old ideas as to <em>above and below</em>;
that is to say, for instance, your idea of ascending on high towards
heaven was thereby nullified, and ascending from the surface of
the earth meant going in any direction which the earth’s rotation
might place above your head at any particular moment. But Dr.
Ward, who was doubtless thinking of the very old and exploded
notion that the earth was a flat surface, does not seem to have been
aware that this objection applies in principle to the Ptolemaic
system also; Ptolemy knew that the earth was spherical in its
shape, and consequently that what would be <em>above</em> a person in the
eastern parts of India, to take an example, would be widely different
from that which would be so at the westernmost point of Africa.
It may, however, be admitted that an additional cause for
bewilderment was presented by the diurnal rotation of the Earth,
since it then appeared that the same point in space <em>above</em> you at

many objects that appear to us as stars, are in reality nebulæ in a
more or less advanced stage of condensation.</p></div>

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_24" href="#FNanchor_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> The <em>relative</em> distances could be computed geometrically, even
before the absolute distances were known, and in fact were so;
Kepler’s third law affords a simple rule for calculating them, but
they were known even previously.</p></div>

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_25" href="#FNanchor_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> I may, perhaps, be permitted to recall to the reader’s mind,
in a note, one or two of the main objections urged by the anti-Copernicans.
One of these was that it would leave the atmosphere
behind, the true answer to which is that the atmosphere itself is
attracted by the force of gravity to the earth, and is carried round
by the rotation, as everything else is; this Galileo did not perfectly
understand, as may be seen by his remarks, both in the second
and the fourth day’s dialogue. Another was this—and it was put
forward by no less a man than Tycho Brahé—a stone dropped
from a high tower ought to fall to the westward of the tower,
because the tower would be carried on to the east by the earth’s
rotation, and the stone would not; this, however, being contrary
to experience. The real fact is that the stone partakes of the
rotatory movement as much as the tower does, the two forces of
rotation and gravity being combined according to the second law
of motion, while the stone is falling; this Galileo did know.
Supposing a very high tower, the stone ought to fall slightly to the
east, on account of the superior velocity of rotation at the top of
the tower to that at the bottom. It is said this experiment has
been successfully tried, as stated in note, page 55.</p></div>

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_26" href="#FNanchor_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> There are other laws, besides that of the inverse square of the
distance, which would cause a body to move in an ellipse, at least
if the force acting on it were placed, not in the focus, but in the
centre of the orbit. The question has been discussed with reference
to some of the binary stars which appear to move round one
another in ellipses. No doubt is thereby raised as to the prevalence
of the law of the inverse square in our own solar system,
where it has been verified by long and careful observation; the
doubt (I think we may say a comparatively slight one) is whether
the same law extends to the whole stellar universe, where, of
course, accurate observation is impracticable.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_27" href="#FNanchor_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> I do not think the truth of this is affected by any of the
great modern discoveries; though that of the Conservation of
Energy approaches more nearly than others to Universal Gravitation
in its importance.</p></div>
